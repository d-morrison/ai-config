## Run UMS proactively, as learnings accumulate

Don't wait for `/clear` or the end of a task to run `ums` (Update Memories and Skills).
As soon as a learning worth saving shows up during a session — a corrected mistake, a new preference, a tool quirk, a workflow gap — run UMS right then, interleaved with the main work, rather than batching it for a wrap-up step at the end.

Still run UMS before `/clear` too, as a final catch-all for anything accumulated since the last proactive pass — but treat that as a backstop, not the trigger to wait for.

**In a multi-PR/multi-issue session (GII-style), treat each PR merge as a concrete proactive-UMS checkpoint, not just "whenever a learning happens to surface."**
"As learnings accumulate" is easy to defer indefinitely during heads-down execution across several PRs, since no single moment feels like the obvious trigger --- a merge is a natural, unmissable boundary to pause at instead.

**A PR's clean review verdict is a proactive-UMS checkpoint in its own right, and it fires strictly earlier than the merge -- run the pass there rather than holding it until the PR lands.**
The bullet above picked the merge because it is unmissable, and it is; the problem is that it may never arrive on this session's clock.
Merging is human-gated: [`ardi`](shared/workflow/ardi.md)'s terminal action is to report the PR ready, never to merge it.
So a clean-but-unmerged PR can sit for hours, for days, or across a `/clear`, and the review lifecycle's learnings sit with it in conversation state that may not survive the wait.
Waiting buys nothing either, because by the time the verdict is clean every finding has already been Addressed, Rebutted, or Deferred -- the review has taught everything it is going to teach, and the merge adds only whatever the merge itself surfaces.
So run UMS when the verdict comes back clean, and treat the merge-time pass as a top-up rather than the trigger.

**Offering to run UMS is not running it.**
Everything above rules out *deferring* the pass to a wrap-up step.
It has to rule out the adjacent move as well, because that one reads as compliance rather than evasion: surface the learning now, and run the pass once the user says go.

An offer to run UMS is worth exactly what an unrecorded learning is worth, since both live only in the conversation and both die with it.
The two asymmetries that decide it are already written down, for issues rather than for learnings, in [`report-mistakes-proactively`](shared/workflow/report-mistakes-proactively.md)'s "Filing is not gated on approval" section: a redundant entry is cheap while a lost one is not, and only the user can say a thing is not worth keeping --- which they can do after it is written, not only before.
Read that section rather than re-deriving the argument here.
The pattern is identical, and only the artifact differs.

What stays genuinely worth asking is **where** a learning belongs when the destination is unclear, never **whether** to record it --- the same split that fragment draws around its own dupe-check step.
Write it down first, then ask.

**The offer also survives being phrased as a decision, and that form is harder to see.**
The bullet above rules out the question.
It does not rule out the sentence that states an intention and then hands the timing back: "I'll run it now unless you'd rather I do something else first."

That reads as a commitment rather than a request, which is exactly why it passes self-review.
It is not one.
The pass still does not start, the user still has to spend a turn, and the trailing clause is doing the same work the question did --- it just moved the gate from *whether* to *when*.
It usually appears at the end of a long status recap, where it reads as courtesy about sequencing rather than as a request for permission.

The test is mechanical, so apply it rather than judging the tone: **if the sentence about UMS contains a conditional referring to the user, it is an offer.**
"Unless you'd rather", "if that works", "let me know if" --- all of them.
Run the pass, then report it in the past tense, and put any genuine sequencing question in its own sentence about the *other* work.

- **Do:** run the pass and say "ran UMS; here is what it recorded".
- **Do:** ask about ordering the remaining work, once the pass is already done.
- **Don't:** attach a user-conditional to a stated intention to run it.
- **Don't:** read "I will" as sufficient --- the trailing clause is what decides it.

**A new instruction arriving at a checkpoint does not cancel the checkpoint.**
The bullet above covers the pass you *announce* and never run; this is the one you never announce at all, because something else arrived first.
A merge or clean verdict is usually the exact moment I report back, so it is also the moment the next request lands.
That request then reads as the live task, and the checkpoint silently evaporates -- never refused, never deferred out loud, just never performed.
Note the asymmetry with the deferral the earlier bullets describe: there no moment feels like the trigger, whereas here a moment *did* fire and was preempted.
The remedies differ, and the preempted case cannot be fixed by naming more checkpoints.

The fix is cheap, because the pass is short.
When a request arrives at a checkpoint, either run UMS first and then start the request, or say in the same reply that the pass is owed and when it will run -- the latter being a real commitment, per the bullet above, not an offer.

The same skip has a second route worth checking, since several skills end in a UMS step ([`post-merge`](skills/post-merge/SKILL.md), [`ardi`](shared/workflow/ardi.md), [`wrap-up`](skills/wrap-up/SKILL.md)).
Reporting one of those skills complete asserts that its final step ran, so before calling a merge wrapped up, confirm the UMS pass actually happened rather than only the steps before it.

**A merge you discover rather than perform is still a checkpoint, and it is the one that never feels like a moment.**
Every bullet above describes a checkpoint that *happens* while you are watching: you push, the verdict lands, the PR merges, you report back.
The merge someone else performs while you are away arrives differently --- as a row in a status table, hours later, alongside a dozen other rows.
Nothing about reading `MERGED` in a poll resembles the event the rule was written for, so the checkpoint passes without ever presenting itself as one.

The asymmetry is worth naming because it inverts the usual risk.
A checkpoint you witness is at least *available* to be skipped.
This one is never noticed to begin with, and the more of them arrive at once, the less any single one reads as an occasion to stop.
A status poll that flips several PRs from open to merged is therefore a strong UMS trigger, not a weak one.

So treat any transition **to** merged as the trigger, whoever performed it and whenever you learn of it.
The cheap check is the poll you are already running: if a PR you were driving reads merged now and did not last time you looked, the pass is owed.

- **Do:** run the pass when a status query first shows a PR merged, exactly as if you had merged it yourself.
- **Do:** treat a batch of merges discovered together as one checkpoint carrying all of their learnings, rather than as background news.
- **Don't:** require that you witnessed the merge for it to count.
- **Don't:** let a poll that reports several merges roll straight into the next task because no single row felt like an event.

**Recommending that the session end is itself a UMS trigger, and it is the one route where skipping the pass destroys the learnings rather than merely delaying them.**
The three bullets above all describe a pass that is *postponed*: no moment felt like the trigger, or a moment fired and was announced, or a moment fired and was preempted.
In each of those the material survives in the conversation, so a later pass can still recover it.
This route closes that door.
Proposing `/clear`, a fresh session, or a handoff while the pass is owed is proposing to discard exactly what the pass exists to save, and the recommendation reads as responsible precisely because it is framed as tidying up.

Disclosing the owed pass in the same message as the `/clear` flag is not enough either.
That is the *offer* failure one level up: it names the debt in the same breath as recommending the action that voids it, which leaves the user to notice the contradiction.
So invert the order.
Run the pass, then flag the stopping point.
A flag that has to mention an owed UMS is a flag raised too early.

**"I am low on context" does not exempt it, and that claim needs the same test any other asserted blocker does** (see [`ardi`](shared/workflow/ardi.md)'s "Verify a blocker you assert").
It is the one blocker that is never tested, because it feels like introspection rather than a claim, and it is self-serving in a way the others are not: it excuses the work while sounding diligent.
The asymmetry also runs the wrong way for caution.
A pass that records the top three learnings in a few edits is worth far more than a thorough one that never runs, so shrink the pass rather than deferring it, and say what got left out.
If context genuinely runs out mid-pass, the entries already written are durable and the session ends having banked most of the value.

- **Do:** run the pass, then flag the stopping point, then let the user decide how to end the session.
- **Do:** shrink a pass you genuinely cannot finish, record the top items first, and say what was left out.
- **Don't:** recommend `/clear`, a fresh session, or a handoff while a pass is owed, however clearly the debt is disclosed alongside it.
- **Don't:** cite remaining context as a reason to defer, without having attempted the pass.

**"That would mean another open PR" is the same deferral wearing repo hygiene, and it is the one that sounds like good judgment.**
Every bullet above rules out a deferral whose stated reason is about *me* --- no moment felt like the trigger, a request preempted it, context is short.
This one's stated reason is about the **repo**, so it reads as restraint rather than avoidance: holding a fourth concurrent PR looks like consideration for the reviewer and the merge queue.

Three things dissolve it.
A UMS PR is *usually* disjoint --- it touches a memory file or a fragment nothing else in flight is editing --- so it usually costs no merge-order constraint and no conflict, which is exactly the case `CLAUDE.md`'s own merge-order section says to state plainly rather than manage.
Verify that rather than assuming it, because two UMS passes in one session land in the same few files and collide readily.
When they do, the answer is still to open the PR and resolve the collision, not to hold the pass.
The queue is durable and the learning is not: an extra open PR waits patiently, while an unrecorded learning dies with the session, so the two costs are not comparable.
And the deferral is usually announced in the same breath as reporting a PR ready, which is the moment the next instruction arrives --- so "once this lands" reliably becomes never.

The permission to announce a pass rather than run it, granted above, is for a **real** blocker.
Not wanting another PR is a preference, and a preference does not license the announcement.

- **Do:** open the UMS PR immediately, however many of yours are already open, and resolve any collision it turns out to have.
- **Do:** check whether its files overlap your other open PRs, and say either that it is disjoint or exactly where it collides, so the count does not read as a problem.
- **Don't:** defer a pass to keep the open-PR count down, or until an unrelated PR merges.
- **Don't:** treat "I will write it once #N lands" as a commitment --- it is the announced-and-never-run failure with a due date attached.

**Correcting your own understanding of a technical issue is itself a trigger, and it fires immediately rather than at the next checkpoint.**
Every trigger above is an event in the *work*: a verdict lands, a PR merges, a poll reports a merge, a stopping point gets proposed.
This one is an event in what you *believe*, and it leaves no artifact behind.
Nothing merges, no check turns green, and the only record is that you were wrong and then were not.

That absence is why it needs naming rather than being left to "as learnings accumulate".
A corrected misunderstanding feels resolved the moment it is corrected, so the correction reads as the completion when it is only the input.
Nothing is left outstanding, so nothing prompts the pass, and the learning evaporates with the conversation that produced it.
That puts it alongside the recommend-a-fresh-session route above, as a case where skipping the pass destroys the material rather than merely delaying it.
It is also unusually valuable material, because a correction names both the model that was wrong and the thing that displaced it -- which is exactly the pair the section below asks every entry to carry.

So run the pass at the correction, not at the end of whatever task the correction unblocked.
The task will still be there; what you believed ten minutes ago will not.

- **Do:** run the pass as soon as a technical belief is corrected, before resuming the work it was blocking.
- **Do:** record the belief that was wrong alongside the fact that replaced it, not just the fact.
- **Don't:** wait for the unblocked task to reach a checkpoint of its own -- that checkpoint carries the task's learnings, not the correction's.
- **Don't:** treat "I know the right answer now" as the pass having happened.

**A false claim about *state* is the same trigger, and it is the one you can be wrong about without ever holding a wrong belief.**
The bullet above covers a corrected *understanding* --- a model of how something works, which you held, and which turned out to be false.
The commoner failure has no belief in it at all.
You assert that a repository is public, that a PR is green, that a corpus lacks a feature, that a list has nine entries.
None of those were things you thought.
They are things you did not look up, or looked up once against a stale checkout and then repeated.

That absence is why the trigger above does not obviously fire here.
Nothing that feels like a belief gets corrected, so the discovery reads as a small factual fix rather than as the event this section is about.
It also arrives mid-task, at the moment the natural impulse is to repair the claim and carry on --- which is the opposite of a checkpoint, and is exactly when nothing prompts a pass.

Treat any discovery that you were wrong as the trigger, whatever kind of wrong it was.
The class matters for what you *record*, not for whether the pass runs: a corrected belief yields the belief and its replacement, while a false state claim yields the query you should have run, which is the more reusable of the two.

Two mechanisms make this survivable rather than merely mandated.
**Delegate the pass**, per "Use subagents when helpful" below, which already pre-authorizes an owed UMS pass as sidecar work --- that is what keeps the pass from competing with the task the correction interrupted.
And **algorithmatize the trigger** rather than relying on noticing it, per [`algorithmatize-checks`](shared/workflow/algorithmatize-checks.md): `hooks/remind-ums-after-error.py` detects a first-person admission in the transcript and injects a reminder on the next prompt when no memory, skill, or shared write followed it.
That hook only ever *adds context*.
An error admission must never be blocked, delayed, or suppressed --- see its own docstring, and the "Never activate a new hook before its PR merges" gate in [`README.md`](README.md).
Building such an instrument is itself delegable sidecar work, not a reason to postpone the pass.

- **Do:** run the pass the moment you discover any claim of yours was false, including one you never believed so much as asserted.
- **Do:** record the *query that settles it* for a state claim, not just the corrected value.
- **Do:** delegate the pass, and delegate the instrument, rather than queueing either.
- **Don't:** treat a factual correction as too small to record because no belief changed.
- **Don't:** wait for the task the correction interrupted to reach a checkpoint of its own.

## Record both the pattern and the anti-pattern

When I tell you what to do, or what not to do, in a `cai` or `ums` statement, write down **both** sides: the behaviour to adopt and the behaviour to stop.
Record them explicitly, as a labelled pair, not as a paragraph that leaves one side implied.

Both halves carry information the other cannot.
A rule stated only as the anti-pattern says what to stop without saying what replaces it, which invites a second wrong behaviour that merely avoids the named one.
A rule stated only as the pattern is the more common failure and the harder one to notice: it reads as complete, but the specific move that prompted the correction usually *looks* like compliance from the inside, so the next reader has to re-derive which near-miss was actually being ruled out.
The near-miss is the whole content of the correction.
Naming it is what makes the entry falsifiable rather than merely agreeable.

Keep the pair concrete enough to check against.
"Do: run the pass before flagging a stopping point" and "Don't: recommend a fresh session while a pass is owed" both name an observable action, whereas "be diligent about UMS" names nothing and cannot be violated.
Where a correction only ever surfaced as one side, derive the other rather than omitting it, and say which side came from the user and which you inferred.

This applies to how the entry is *written*, so it composes with whatever the entry is about.
It also applies to this entry: below is its own pair.

- **Do:** state the adopted behaviour and the retired one, labelled, in every `cai`/`ums` entry that records a correction.
- **Do:** make each side an action a later reader could observe you taking or not taking.
- **Don't:** write only the corrected behaviour and leave the reader to infer which specific move it displaced.
- **Don't:** state the pair so abstractly that no concrete action would violate it.

## Flag good moments to `/clear` in long-running sessions

Proactively tell me — don't wait to be asked — when a session has grown long and hits a natural stopping point: a multi-step task or loop (GII/ARDIA/GIP, a research pass) just checkpointed or fully wrapped, a PR merged with no other in-flight work riding on this conversation, or an open question just got answered with nothing left pending.
Use the `⚠️ FLAG` tag from this file's chat-output-tagging convention, one line, at the natural end of that turn's recap — don't interrupt mid-task to say it.

Don't suggest it when there's still live state only this conversation holds: a background agent or CI run still in flight that I'm tracking, **any PR this session opened or pushed to that has not yet merged or closed**, an unanswered question, or a mid-investigation train of thought that would be expensive to reconstruct.
`/clear` wipes conversation state outright (unlike compaction, which summarizes) — anything not already durable (in `CLAUDE.md`, a memory file, or a tracked issue/PR) is gone.
If UMS hasn't run recently, run it *before* raising the flag rather than disclosing the debt inside it, per "Recommending that the session end is itself a UMS trigger" above.

**That PR clause is a bright line, not a judgment call, and it was narrowed deliberately.**
It used to read "a PR I'm actively babysitting", which invites the question of whether *this* PR still counts as active --- and the answer always sounds like no.
A PR whose checks are green and whose review has not come back yet feels finished: there is nothing to do, so there is nothing live.
That reading is what the rule has to rule out, because "waiting on a review round" is the single most common state for a PR to be in when a session reaches a natural pause, and it is exactly when the flag is most tempting.

Two things make an unmerged PR live regardless of how quiet it looks.
[`ardi`](shared/workflow/ardi.md) obliges the session to keep monitoring it until it merges or closes, so proposing a stop proposes abandoning that loop mid-flight.
And a review can still come back with findings, which is work only this conversation has the context to address cheaply.

Open PRs belonging to *other* sessions do not trigger this --- `wrap-up`'s sweep surfaces them, and they are worth reporting, but they are not this conversation's live state.

- **Do:** hold the flag until every PR this session opened or pushed to has merged or closed.
- **Do:** report an unmerged PR's status plainly instead, with no stopping-point suggestion attached.
- **Don't:** treat "green checks, just awaiting review" as not-live --- it is the archetypal live PR.
- **Don't:** flag a stopping point and disclose the open PR in the same breath, which is the same too-early flag the UMS rule above rejects.

**Run `wrap-up`'s state sweep *before* flagging a stopping point, not after the user asks for one.**
The paragraph above says not to flag while live state remains; it doesn't say how to know.
Answering that from memory only covers the PRs and branches *this conversation* created, which is exactly the blind spot: a bot-opened PR, a leftover branch from the harness or an earlier session in the same container, or another session's PR in the same repo never entered the conversation, so nothing about them feels outstanding.
Run the sweep --- open PRs and issues per repo, `git status`, local branches, worktrees --- and let its output decide, the same way [`fully-clean`](shared/workflow/fully-clean.md) insists a PR's readiness comes from a fresh query rather than a cached verdict.

**Two mechanical details about that leftover-branch case, one of which reads as the opposite of what it is.**
The harness assigns its branch name in *every* scoped repo and leaves each one checked out on it, including repos the session never opens.
So the sweep finds the branch sitting in places nothing in the conversation points at, and two things follow from that.

Point 3 of the "Keep ai-config and repo checkouts fresh" section quietly does nothing in those repos.
It fast-forwards `main` only when `main` is the checked-out branch, and here it never is, so a repo you never opened stays as stale as the container left it.

And `git branch -D` refuses, with `cannot delete branch 'X' used by worktree at '<path>'`.
That message names a worktree, which reads as a second checkout holding live parallel work --- the one condition that would genuinely make deleting the branch unsafe.
It is almost always just that repo's ordinary checkout sitting on the branch.
So the cautious reading is the wrong one here, and acting on it leaves a dead branch in place for the next session to re-discover and re-adjudicate.

Settle liveness from the branch's own commits rather than from the error text, and settle it before deleting anything.
Zero commits in `origin/main..<branch>`, plus absence from the remote, together mean there is nothing to lose.
Resist adding an ancestry check beside the first of those.
An empty `origin/main..<branch>` range is the same fact as `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> origin/main` succeeding, so running both confirms one thing twice rather than two things once.
Once liveness is settled, switch that repo to `main` --- which is what the refusal is really asking for --- and then delete.

- **Do:** run the sweep across every scoped repo, not only the ones this session worked in.
- **Do:** settle liveness first, then `git checkout main` in that repo, then `git branch -D`.
- **Don't:** read `used by worktree` as evidence that a separate live worktree exists.
- **Don't:** assume a repo the session never opened is on `main`.

**When flagging a good moment to `/clear`, offer archiving as the default alternative.** Whenever there's a meaningful chance I'd want to come back to this conversation later, recommend leaving the session alone and starting a fresh one for the next task, instead of `/clear`ing it -- the old session stays fully retrievable (nothing to lose), at the cost of a small navigation step to reopen it. Reserve a bare `/clear` recommendation for when nothing in the session is worth revisiting; when in doubt, default to the archive-and-start-new option since it's strictly safer.

**`/compact` is a third alternative, for weak continuity rather than a clean break.**
When the next move is to keep working on *loosely related* things in the same window -- no concrete open item, so not the live state that triggers the `compress-session` flag, but enough of a thread that a clean slate would lose something worth keeping -- recommend `/compact` instead of archive-and-start-new.
It carries a lossy summary forward in place, keeping the gist and skipping the reopen step, at the cost of a session that keeps growing and detail that is lost.
Pick among the options by what the *next* work needs from this session.
Nothing, and unrelated to what's next, is archive-and-start-new by default, or a bare `/clear` only when nothing is worth revisiting;
the gist in the same window is `/compact`;
the full live task state is the `compress-session` flag, not this one.
Archive still beats compact for pure *reference*, since a retrievable full thread dominates a lossy summary, so reserve the compact recommendation for continuation rather than preservation.

**Starting a new PR is itself a moment to weigh compacting, clearing, or a fresh session -- not only a natural stopping point is.**
The options above all fire on a *stopping* point: a task wrapped, a PR merged, a question answered.
Opening a new PR is a *starting* point, and it feels the opposite -- momentum rather than pause -- which is exactly why the consideration gets skipped.
But a new PR is where a fresh chunk of context begins accumulating, so it is the cleanest seam at which to decide whether to carry this session forward or reset, and deciding *before* the new state exists is cheaper than untangling it after.

So before opening a new PR, pause and pick from the same menu, by what the *new* PR needs from this session:

- Unrelated to everything in the current window, and nothing here is worth revisiting -> archive-and-start-new (the default), or a bare `/clear` only when nothing is worth revisiting.
- Builds loosely on the current thread -> `/compact`.
- Small, fresh context -> do nothing and open the PR.

The bright line still governs, and it changes what "reset" can even mean here.
If this session has an unmerged PR it opened or pushed to, it owes that PR active monitoring (per [`ardi`](shared/workflow/ardi.md)), so *this* session must not be `/clear`ed or walked away from -- the new PR either rides along in the same window (where `compress-session` or `/compact` can still lighten the carried context), or goes to a genuinely separate fresh session while this one keeps monitoring.
Only when no such live PR remains is the full menu (archive-and-start-new, `/clear`, `/compact`, or nothing) open, chosen by the criteria above.
Run UMS first if it is owed, per "Recommending that the session end is itself a UMS trigger" above -- not disclosed inside the flag.

- **Do:** pause at the new-PR boundary and recommend the fitting session-management option, before opening the PR.
- **Do:** keep monitoring an unmerged PR in the session that owns it -- send only the *new* PR to a fresh session, rather than resetting the one that owes monitoring.
- **Don't:** barrel into a new PR carrying a long, unrelated session by reflex, just because opening a PR feels like forward motion rather than a stopping point.
- **Don't:** `/clear` or abandon a session while a PR it opened is still unmerged -- that drops the monitoring loop the bright line protects.

## Flag good moments to run `compress-session`, too

The mid-task counterpart to the section above: don't wait for the automatic compaction to guess what matters, and don't wait to be asked.
Proactively flag (same `⚠️ FLAG` tag) when a session is still mid-task but has grown large — many tool calls, long tool outputs (test/CI logs, big diffs) no longer needed once their conclusions are captured, or a session that's already been through one automatic compaction and is heading for another.
Then run `compress-session` yourself: write the focused distillation and, if compaction looks imminent, trigger `/compact focus on <what matters>` rather than leaving it to the automatic pass.

Use this instead of the `/clear` flag above when there's still live state worth carrying forward: an unfinished task, an unmerged PR this session opened or pushed to, or an open question.
`/clear` is for a clean task boundary with nothing left to carry.
This is for continuing the same work with a lighter context.
That middle item uses the same bright line as the section above, deliberately: the two are complements, so a PR that disqualifies the `/clear` flag is exactly what makes `compress-session` the right tool instead.

## Actively manage quota usage: models and compaction

Treat quota as something to manage continuously through a session, not only at a wrap-up or fan-out moment.
Two levers; when either applies, act on it without waiting to be asked.

**Model tier.**
For dispatched work (`Agent` calls, `Workflow` `agent()` calls), route model and effort per [`when-to-orchestrate`](shared/workflow/when-to-orchestrate.md)'s "Route each agent's model/effort" section.
Cheap tier for mechanical, bounded work; inherit or escalate only for judgment-heavy work.
Don't default every dispatched call to the conductor's own tier out of caution.

The conductor's own tier cannot be switched from inside the conversation --- it's client-side only (`memories/preferences.md`).
So the lever there is to **recommend** a change rather than make one.
When the current tier is clearly underpowered for the task ahead, say so and suggest escalating via `/model` or `select-model`.
When a long stretch of ahead-of-time-known mechanical work doesn't need the current tier, say so and prefer delegating it instead.
That means a cheaper-tier subagent, or `delegate-to-codex` before spending this session's own quota, per the standing "exhaust codex before using our own" preference --- rather than burning the conductor's tier on it.
Ground the recommendation in `assess-model-fit`/`select-model` rather than a guess.

**Compaction.**
Already covered by the two sections above --- the `/clear` flag for a clean stopping point, and the `compress-session` flag for mid-task bloat.
Add quota/usage pressure itself as a trigger for both, distinct from context size alone.
The agent has no direct view into it, though --- the usage bar lives in the client's UI, not in the conversation (`memories/preferences.md`).
So key this off what's actually visible: the user naming or showing usage pressure, or --- inside a `Workflow` run with a stated token target --- `budget.spent()`/`budget.remaining()`.
Either is reason enough to compress or recommend a lighter model, on the same terms those sections already set out.

When both levers genuinely apply at once, do the self-directed one first.
Compress or compact before asking the user to act on a model change.
Only the second one costs them a step.

## Keep a running on-disk session lab notebook

Maintain a "lab notebook" for each session — a dated, append-only file written to *as work happens*, not only when pausing — so that if the session is interrupted with no clean exit (compaction, a forced `/clear`, a crash, a SLURM walltime death), the trail is already on disk and a later session (or I) can pick it up.
The whole point is surviving an interruption that never gives you a clean stop, so the file must live on disk and be updated frequently, not held in context and flushed at the end.

**Where.** In the session's project auto-memory directory, as a `session-YYYY-MM-DD[-slug].md` file, with a one-line pointer added to that directory's `MEMORY.md` like any other memory.
One notebook per session; start it near session start and keep appending.

**Cadence — frequently, and to disk right away.** Append a short, timestamped entry at each state change worth resuming from: a task or subtask started, a decision made or a question I answered, a PR/issue opened, a branch cut, a job launched (SLURM/background/CI, with its id), a blocker hit, a checkpoint reached.
Not every tool call — that's noise — but every step whose loss would cost real reconstruction.

**What each entry carries.** Enough for a cold reader to resume without this conversation: what we're doing and why, what's done versus in flight (branches, open PRs/issues, running jobs and their ids), open questions and decisions, and the next concrete step.

**Relationship to the pause-time and context conventions.** The notebook is the *running recorder*; the others are point-in-time:

- `handoff` writes a single snapshot *when you pause cleanly* — the notebook is its always-current substrate, so a handoff can finalize or point at the notebook instead of rebuilding state from scratch.
- `compress-session` distills the *conversation context* to survive compaction — the notebook is a durable on-disk trail, not a context-window optimization.
- The `/clear` flag above is about *choosing* a clean stop — the notebook is insurance for the stops you don't choose.

Fold a finished session's notebook into durable memory (or prune it) during UMS once its content is captured elsewhere, so the memory directory doesn't accumulate stale logs.

## Keep ai-config and repo checkouts fresh

In every session — at session start, and again periodically during long sessions — refresh the local state that goes stale as PRs merge elsewhere:

1. **The ai-config checkout.** Check that the local ai-config clone is on `main` — not a leftover work branch from an earlier session — and run `git pull --ff-only`.
   Only switch back to `main` when the working tree is clean; leave a dirty tree or another session's in-flight work alone and flag it instead.
   **If `pull --ff-only` fails with "diverged" rather than a dirty-tree error**, don't assume unpushed work is at risk — a fresh container can seed local `main` from a stale/orphaned snapshot (e.g. a pre-history-rewrite state) whose commits never landed on `origin/main` at all.
   Confirm the working tree is clean (`git status --short`) and spot-check a couple of the "unique" local commit messages against `git log origin/main` — if they don't appear there either (not even under a different hash), the divergent commits are orphaned, not real work, and it's safe to realign: `git checkout -B main origin/main`.
   Still flag it rather than force if the tree is dirty or the messages *do* look like genuine unpushed work.
   **If `main` isn't the currently checked-out branch** (the session is already working on a feature branch), skip the checkout dance entirely — `git branch -f main origin/main` realigns the ref in place without touching the working tree or switching away from the branch you're actively on.
2. **The `~/.claude` consumer copies.** On symlink-capable systems the children of `~/.claude` (`skills/`, `shared/`, `commands/`, `memories/`) are symlinks into the checkout, so the pull alone refreshes them; rerun `bootstrap.sh` only when the repo gained a new top-level dir.
   On Windows, Git Bash `ln -s` silently falls back to **real copies**, so a pull does NOT propagate there — copy-sync every file whose repo version changed into `~/.claude`.
   Before overwriting, check for edits made directly in `~/.claude` (a diff that adds prose the repo lacks) and upstream the genuine ones into the repo first; never clobber an un-upstreamed local edit.
   Don't rely on mtime to spot local edits — git operations reset mtimes on checkout, so it false-positives right after a `pull`, the case this check most needs to handle correctly.
   **Don't read "symlink-capable system" as "therefore all four children are symlinks" -- verify per child, because the split can fall inside one `~/.claude`.**
   In a remote/web container, a subset of `~/.claude/skills/` ends up as real directories holding older content, which shadow the repo for the whole session.
   `shared/`, `memories/`, `commands/`, and `CLAUDE.md` symlink normally in the same container, which is what makes this hard to spot: the child that silently doesn't refresh is the one carrying the procedures you are about to follow.
   `git pull` cannot fix it, because the loaded file is a copy rather than a link.
   Don't sweep this by hand.
   Run the instrument, which compares whole trees rather than `SKILL.md` alone and repairs what it finds, backing up every displaced copy:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/scripts/check-install.py          # report
   python3 ~/.claude/scripts/check-install.py --fix     # repair
   ```
   It reports `stale` (a real copy that has drifted -- the active defect), `unlinked` (a real copy that matches today but won't track the next pull), `missing`, `misdirected`, and `foreign`.
   **`~/.claude/scripts/` can itself be absent, and then that command is unreachable in exactly the container it diagnoses -- run the repo's own copy instead of concluding there is no instrument.**
   The path above assumes `~/.claude` links back to the checkout; a container can ship `~/.claude` holding **only** a real-copy `skills/`, with no `scripts/`, `shared/`, `memories/`, `commands/`, or `CLAUDE.md` at all, which is a strictly worse shape than the partial split described above.
   `$HOME` need not be anywhere near the checkout either (`/root` versus `/home/user/ai-config`), so a `~`-relative path is the wrong instrument for finding the repo at all.
   Run `python3 <ai-config-checkout>/scripts/check-install.py` against the checkout the session actually has.
   **Point 1 is a precondition for this one, not merely an earlier item in a list.**
   The instrument compares installed copies against the checkout, so a checkout that has not been pulled makes every report suspect -- both by measuring drift against stale reference content, and by hiding the script itself when it landed in a commit you do not have yet.
   Pull first, then measure, and re-read any figure taken before the pull as unreliable rather than merely approximate.
   **`foreign` is reported but never removed, and is not a synonym for "deleted from the repo".**
   The category mixes skills we deleted with Anthropic-provided built-ins that were never ours (`docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `skill-creator`), and deleting those would remove working harness functionality.
   Git history cannot separate the two, because remote containers check the repo out **shallow** -- `git log --diff-filter=D -- skills/<name>` returns nothing for either case -- so the call stays human.
   The repo's `UserPromptSubmit` hook runs the repair once per session, so this is normally already done by the time you would think to check.
   **The clobber happens after `bootstrap.sh`, not before it, so don't diagnose this as bootstrap skipping a pre-seeded copy.**
   Measured in one container: at `07:25:00.084` bootstrap reported 527 `already linked` and zero skips, so every skill was still a symlink; `~/.claude/skills` was then modified at `07:25:01.608`, leaving 53 real directories.
   The upstream cause is `upload_skills.sh`, which is idempotent by **skipping** any skill already in the workspace (`skip (exists)`) rather than adding a version, so the workspace copy the harness syncs down stays frozen at whatever revision was first uploaded.
   That is why a repair wired into `SessionStart` would run before the damage and report a clean install every time.
   **`check-install.py` says nothing about whether the hooks are *registered*, so run `install-hooks.py` as a separate freshness check.**
   The two answer different questions and are easy to conflate, because both concern `~/.claude` and both report a tidy count.
   `check-install.py` compares **files**: it asks whether `~/.claude/hooks/<script>` tracks the checkout.
   `install-hooks.py` compares **bindings**: it asks whether `~/.claude/settings.json` actually invokes those scripts on an event.
   A hook can be perfectly linked and never run, so a clean report from the first is not evidence about the second.
   The failure is silent in the way this corpus is worst at noticing: an unregistered guard and a guard with nothing to block look identical, since neither ever produces output.
   It also degrades **one hook at a time** rather than all at once, which is why nothing announces it --- `bootstrap.sh` places every new script, while registration happens only when someone runs the second command, so each hook added since the last run sits inert.
   That makes it a per-session freshness item rather than a one-time setup step.
   ```bash
   python3 <ai-config-checkout>/scripts/install-hooks.py          # report
   python3 <ai-config-checkout>/scripts/install-hooks.py --fix     # register the missing ones
   ```
   Four caveats before running `--fix`.
   Check `enabledPlugins` in `settings.json` first: if the ai-config **plugin** is enabled it already loads every hook in `hooks/hooks.json`, and `--fix` then registers each one a second time under a different command string, so every hook fires twice --- the two paths are mutually exclusive, per README.
   And hooks connect at **session start**, so a mid-session `--fix` arms nothing until a restart.
   Say so rather than reporting the guards as live.
   **Run `check-install.py --fix` first, so the scripts are on disk before anything binds to them.**
   `install-hooks.py` only writes `settings.json`.
   It never places a file, and it does not check that the script it is registering exists.
   Registering a hook whose file is absent is worse than leaving it unregistered: an unregistered guard is inert, while a registered-but-absent `PreToolUse` `Bash` hook makes `python3` exit 2 on **every** Bash call and takes the shell down.
   `--fix` prints the note naming this division of labour only when run *without* `--fix`, so the run that causes the damage is the one that stays silent about it.
   **Point 1 governs this instrument too, and its stale run is the more dangerous of the two.**
   A stale `check-install.py` run reports suspect numbers.
   A stale `install-hooks.py` run reads an old `hooks/hooks.json`, finds every hook it knows about already bound, and prints `All hooks registered.` --- a positive all-clear over hooks it cannot see.
   Pull first, then measure, and treat the examined count as the thing to read: it is the manifest's size, so a number below the current hook count means the checkout is behind rather than the machine being clean.
   - **Do:** run both instruments each session, in the order place-then-bind, and report the two counts separately.
   - **Do:** compare `install-hooks.py`'s `examined N` against the current `hooks/hooks.json` before believing `All hooks registered.`
   - **Don't:** read `check-install.py`'s `N/N ok` as meaning the guards are active --- it never looked at `settings.json`.
   - **Don't:** run `install-hooks.py --fix` as the whole of "arm these hooks" --- it binds, it never places.

3. **The working repo's main checkout.**
   Fast-forward the `main` checkout of whatever repo the session is working on (`git fetch origin`, then `git pull --ff-only` when `main` is checked out) --- it goes stale as the session's own PRs and other sessions' PRs merge.
   **The same "diverged" failure from point 1 above can hit any repo's `main`, not just ai-config's own** --- a fresh container's checkout isn't guaranteed fresh for every repo it holds.
   Apply the same recovery: confirm the working tree is clean, then check whether the local tip's commit is actually reachable from `origin/main` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <local-tip> origin/main`) before force-realigning with `git checkout -B main origin/main`.
   Don't rely on a commit-message grep alone to decide safety --- the same message can appear under a *different hash* after a squash-merge or rebase (so the grep matches but the underlying commits differ, the milder case in point 1), and `git log origin/main` only reflects whatever your local remote-tracking ref last fetched (so a check run before fetching in this session can miss commits that already landed).
   Re-run `git fetch origin main` immediately beforehand and use the hash-based ancestry check as the authoritative signal.
   A clean working tree plus a non-ancestor local `main` tip is still safe to realign in the common case (the checkout is stale, not carrying real work), since realigning only moves a local branch ref --- the discarded commits stay recoverable via `git reflog` regardless.
4. **The `.ai-config` submodule pin, in any repo that vendors ai-config as a git submodule** (check `.gitmodules` for a `.ai-config` entry — not every repo has one; most consume ai-config only via the Plugin Marketplace, which doesn't need this). Compare the pinned commit against ai-config's current `origin/main`: `git rev-parse HEAD:.ai-config` for the pin's SHA, then `git -C <path-to-a-local-ai-config-clone> rev-list --count <pin>..origin/main` for how far behind it is.
   A pin more than a few weeks or dozens of commits stale is worth refreshing: file a tracking issue, bump it (`git submodule update --init --remote .ai-config` from the parent repo handles both init and fetch in one step; or, if already checked out, `git fetch origin` inside the submodule before `git checkout origin/main`), then `git add .ai-config` in the parent repo to record the new gitlink, verify the parent repo's own checks still pass, and open a PR.
   Before assuming this is risk-free, check whether the parent repo's CI actually reads the submodule's checked-out content (vs. treating it as inert until a dev runs `git submodule update --init` locally) --- a pin bump is a pure pointer change with no functional surface only when nothing reads it.
   **When the current checkout isn't `main` itself** (a feature branch or a worktree), `HEAD:.ai-config` only reflects that branch's own pin --- it can look badly stale purely because the branch was cut before a bump PR merged into `main`, not because the project's actual pin needs refreshing.
   Also check `origin/main:.ai-config` (the pin as recorded on the base branch) against ai-config's `origin/main`;
   if that one is already fresh, no bump PR is needed --- the branch's own pin resolves itself on its next merge/rebase.
   On Windows Git Bash, that comparison command hits an MSYS gotcha --- see `memories/git.md`.
   **When *adding a new citation* to an ai-config shared fragment inside a submodule-consuming repo's own `CLAUDE.md`, verify --- don't assume --- that the citation already resolves.**
   It only does once BOTH (a) the source PR has merged into ai-config's `main`, and (b) that repo's own `.ai-config` pin has been bumped to a commit containing the path --- the pin doesn't auto-follow `main`.
   Check with `git show <pin>:<path>` (or `ls` inside the checked-out submodule) before writing the citation in present tense;
   if either gate hasn't cleared, hedge to future/conditional tense instead of asserting settled fact --- mirroring the "proposed in ai-config#N --- once merged, the fragment lives at ..." convention `gha`'s own `CLAUDE.md` already uses for citing its still-open companion PRs.
   Once the citation does resolve, keep the local **restatement** of the rule's key points alongside the citation rather than trimming to a bare pointer --- unlike a skill distributed via the Plugin Marketplace (point 4's own preamble), `.ai-config`'s `shared/`/`memories/` fragments aren't auto-loaded into agent context --- they only enter it when a `CLAUDE.md` explicitly restates or `@`-references them --- so a bare citation is invisible to an agent that doesn't take the extra step of reading the fragment on demand.

## Timestamp recaps in local time

When printing a status recap or summary, include a timestamp in the user's local time zone (Pacific Time, `America/Los_Angeles` — get it from `TZ=America/Los_Angeles date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"`; the explicit `TZ` enforces PT on a machine set to any other zone).
This makes "as of when" unambiguous when the user reads the recap later.

**Check the `%Z` in the output.** On Windows Git Bash the `TZ` override silently falls back to GMT (any IANA zone name does), so the command above prints GMT, not PT.
If the suffix isn't PDT/PST, fall back to plain `date` when the machine's system zone is already Pacific.
Otherwise use PowerShell: `[System.TimeZoneInfo]::ConvertTimeBySystemTimeZoneId([DateTime]::UtcNow, 'Pacific Standard Time')`.
Note the output format differs from the bash command — it's a raw `DateTime` with no timezone-abbreviation field, so format it yourself if you need the `PDT`/`PST` suffix or a compact form.

## State the actual time when reporting a scheduled check-in

When telling the user I've scheduled a wakeup or check-in (`ScheduleWakeup`, or an equivalent poll-later mechanism), state the clock time it fires at, not just the relative delay or a bare "I scheduled a check-in."
The tool result already returns a clock time (e.g. "Next wakeup scheduled for 08:22:00") — surface that time in the chat reply instead of dropping it, converting to Pacific local time per the "Timestamp recaps in local time" section above if the returned time is in a different zone.
"Scheduled a check-in to continue monitoring both" leaves the user unable to tell whether that's one minute away or twenty; "I'll check back at 08:22 PT (~4 min)" does not.

## Bare keyword directives

Two families of slash skill read as directives when I write them **without** the leading slash: the **queue commands** that amend the task list, and the **judgment grants** that hand a decision back to you.

### Queue commands

I maintain a family of slash skills for managing the task queue and amending requests: `/also`, `/first`, `/next`, `/before`, `/last`, `/and`, `/remember`, `/always`, and `/cascade`.
When I write one of these keywords **without the leading slash** as a directive — e.g. "also fix the test", "remember that ...", "always link PRs in tables", "and bold it", "next, run the spellcheck", "first, revert that" — interpret it using the corresponding skill's semantics rather than as ordinary prose. (`/remember` and `/always` both route to the `memorize` skill; "cascade" means merge stacked PRs' base branches into the PRs stacked on top of them — including main into unstacked PRs — never the PRs into main; see the `cascade` skill.)
When the word is genuinely just part of a sentence (ambiguous), fall back to the plain reading.

### Judgment grants

The same bare-keyword reading applies to the judgment-grant keywords, which are not queue commands and differ from each other in scope.
`daytb` ("do as you think best", and its longhand `do-as-you-think-best`) hands back **one** decision: choose what you would have recommended, act, and report the choice in the past tense -- it expires with that task.
`away` is the session-scoped version, presuming I am not there to answer at all, and `back` revokes it.
`mwc` is the separate grant covering merge authority, which none of the others extend to.
Read a bare "do as you think best" as `daytb`, not as `away` -- the session-wide reading suspends clarifying questions long after I expected them back.

## Link PRs in tables

When listing PRs in a table (or anywhere they could be clickable), make each PR number a markdown link to the PR URL — `[#237](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/237)`.
The plain text form forces the user to copy/paste; the linked form lets them open the PR in one click.

## Tag chat output by category so long recaps stay scannable

Recaps get long across many parallel tracks, so tag categories of output with a stable marker and let the eye jump straight to what needs the user's attention.
Terminal markdown can't force text color, so the emoji plus the `===` frame plus the bold label *is* the signal.
Readers skim past a question or a flag buried mid-paragraph; a marked, set-apart block is harder to miss.

Reserve a **`===` box** for the output a user is waiting on — something they must respond to (a question, an offer, a blocker) or the headline answer they asked for — and use a lighter **emoji-prefix** (bold label, no box) for informational categories they can skim.
Boxing everything defeats the purpose, so keep the box meaningful.

Boxed (a `===` line above and below the labeled block):

- ❓ **QUESTION** — need the user's input. For a real either/or, prefer the AskUserQuestion picker over a boxed question. When a question is posed inline in chat prose rather than through a box, still set it apart — its own paragraph (blank line before and after, since a bare newline collapses back into the surrounding paragraph), in bold.
- 💡 **OFFER** — optional work I can do if they want it.
- 🛑 **BLOCKER** — stopped; need their call.
- ✅ **ANSWER** — the headline answer to a question they asked (put nuance below the box).
- 🧭 **RECOMMENDATION** --- the course of action I think they should take,
  when the decision is theirs.
  Distinct from the two categories it is most easily confused with:
  an ✅ **ANSWER** reports what is true,
  and a 💡 **OFFER** proposes work I would do.
  A recommendation is a judgment about what *they* should do,
  including about things I will not be doing ---
  which PR to merge first, which option to decline, whether to stop.
  Lead the box with the action and put the reasoning below it,
  so the box holds the call rather than the argument for it.
  It boxes because it feeds a decision they are waiting to make;
  an opinion nobody was waiting on is a 📊 **UPDATE** with a view in it,
  and stays unboxed.
  - **Do:** box the recommendation, lead with the action,
    keep the reasoning under the box.
  - **Don't:** bury it in a closing paragraph,
    or fold it into an ✅ **ANSWER** box
    so a factual claim and a judgment read as one thing.
- 🔀 **MERGE ORDER** --- several PRs are ready,
  and merging them in the wrong order would produce a wrong result.
  The one category labeled with a markdown **heading** (`### 🔀 MERGE ORDER`) rather than bold text,
  since a heading is the only "large font" lever a terminal has.
  List the PRs in the order to merge, each linked per "Link PRs in tables" above,
  naming what each one's position depends on.
  The PR-side and draft-gating surfaces live in the "Surface merge-order constraints" section.

Prefixed, no box (informational, frequent):

- 📊 **UPDATE** — status or progress.
- ⚠️ **FLAG** — non-blocking heads-up or risk.
- ✔️ **DONE** — a completed action.
- 🟢 **ALL CLEAR** — nothing needs the user right now; work continues in the background. The recap's standing sign-off.

Keep the markers stable so they become muscle memory.
The set-apart ❓ **QUESTION** format also gives the `prompt-me` / `prompt-me-all` skills a reliable signal to key off when they sweep the transcript for unanswered questions later.
The user may tune the emoji set; the full taxonomy and rationale live in `memories/preferences.md`.

## Surface merge-order constraints

When two or more PRs are open and merging them in the wrong order would produce a wrong result,
say so where I'll act on it, not in ordinary prose I'll skim past.
Three surfaces, escalating in strength; use as many as the situation earns.

1. **In chat** --- the boxed `### 🔀 MERGE ORDER` marker above.
2. **On the PRs** --- lead each affected PR's body with a `> [!IMPORTANT]` alert
   naming that PR's position and its prerequisite,
   e.g. "Merge [#N](url) first --- this PR is stacked on its branch."
   Update or drop the alert once the prerequisite merges.
3. **Draft-gating** --- hold the dependent PR as a draft until its prerequisite merges,
   then mark it ready.
   GitHub won't merge a draft,
   so this makes the wrong action unavailable rather than merely discouraged.

Draft-gating is the last resort, not the default, because it costs something real:
converting a ready PR to draft **drops auto-merge and merge-queue membership**,
and a draft doesn't trigger the `@claude` review bot (see `shared/workflow/pr-on-claim.md`),
so drafting an unreviewed PR stalls its own ARDI loop.
Drive the PR to fully clean first, and draft-gate only if the prerequisite still hasn't merged.
Say in chat and on the PR that it's being held and why,
and un-draft promptly once the prerequisite lands.
A silent draft is never a substitute for stating the order.

This fires only when order changes the outcome:
a stacked PR whose base is another open PR,
a PR that would conflict or show a misleading diff if the other landed first,
a migration that must precede its consumer.
Two PRs touching disjoint files have no constraint,
and saying so plainly is the right answer, not an occasion for the marker.
But "disjoint" is a claim about their file *sets*, so derive both sets and check the intersection before asserting it ---
`gh pr diff <N> --name-only` on each PR, and confirm no path appears in both ---
rather than recalling what each PR is "about", which is `metacognitive-monitoring.md`'s scope-claim failure (check the population, don't recall it).
A follow-up PR that extends into a `shared/` (or any) file a prior PR also edited is a common collision, and the two conflict at merge time.
The rationale behind each surface lives in `memories/preferences.md`,
alongside the rest of the taxonomy.

## Present decisions one at a time

When more than one decision needs my input, go through them one at a time:
pose the single most pressing question, wait for my answer, then pose the next.
Don't batch several decisions into one message or one multi-question `AskUserQuestion` call.

Two reasons.
The answer to the first question often changes or moots the later ones, so a batch makes me answer against stale premises.
And a wall of questions invites a partial reply that leaves the rest silently unanswered — the exact failure mode `prompt-me` / `prompt-me-all` exist to recover from.

Mechanics:

- Rank by how blocking each decision is, most pressing first (the same ranking `prompt-me` uses), and pose only the top one — via a single-question `AskUserQuestion` call for a real either/or, or one boxed ❓ **QUESTION** otherwise.
- Say how many more are queued behind it ("2 more decisions after this one"), so the backlog is visible without being posed.
- Fold each answer into the framing of the next question, and silently drop any queued question the answer mooted.
- Keep working on whatever the pending decision doesn't block while waiting.

This changes how decisions are *posed*, not whether to ask at all: `research-before-asking` still gates each question, and an `away` grant still means don't block on questions — resolve them by judgment, or skip-and-note, per that skill's scope.
And it yields to an explicit request for the full backlog — `prompt-me-all` / "ask me everything at once" is the user opting into a batch view.

## Title Claude sessions with the PR/issue number

Name each Claude Code session (the title shown in the web/app session sidebar) `#NNN brief description` — the number of the PR or issue the session is working, then a short description.
Don't prefix it with "PR" or "Issue"; just the bare `#NNN`.
So `#316 session title convention`, not `PR #316 session title convention` or `PR session title convention`.

## Re-check for latest review findings before reporting PR status

**Before** reporting status on a PR (especially "clean" / "ready to merge"), re-read the **most recent** review comment on the PR.
Don't trust an earlier "verdict" you've cached — a new review may have been posted since (by the @claude bot, by a human, or by a re-trigger), and that newer review may contain findings the old one missed.

Specifically: when scanning checks (`gh pr checks`) shows green or "no failures", that's about CI state, **not** review verdict.
Always pull the latest review comment and parse it for any "Findings", "Issues", "Remaining" sections before declaring a PR ready.

**Filter on the body marker, not on an author login.**
The login a review posts under varies by repo and by run --- `claude`, `claude[bot]`, and `github-actions[bot]` have each been observed carrying a real, complete verdict --- so a login-filtered query silently returns the *previous* round's comment and reads exactly like "no new review yet".
That is a false negative on the one question this section exists to answer, and nothing in the output announces it.
Completed runs start the body with `**Claude finished`, so match that instead:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>/comments --paginate \
  | jq -s '[.[][] | select(.body | test("\\*\\*Claude finished|### Verdict"))] | last | .body'
```

`memories/github.md` carries the full statement, including the placeholder-wording trap when polling a run still in flight.

**Also check formal GitHub reviews, not just issue-style comments — a human's `CHANGES_REQUESTED` can be invisible to a comments-only scan.** A review submitted via GitHub's review UI (as opposed to a plain PR comment) shows up in `gh pr view N --json reviews`, and its top-level `body` is frequently **empty** — the actual finding lives entirely in a per-line inline comment, which only appears via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/N/comments` (a different endpoint from issue comments). Checking `--json comments` alone can miss the review's existence entirely. Before declaring a PR ready, also run:
```
gh pr view N --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED") | "\(.author.login) \(.submittedAt)"'
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/N/comments --jq '.[] | "\(.path):\(.line // .original_line // "?") \(.user.login) \(.body)"'
```
A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` state is blocking regardless of whether an automated re-review later says "Ready for merge" — that bot verdict doesn't clear a human's own review state, which only the human (or an explicit dismissal) can resolve.

(A specific case of the standing **never assume; always verify** rule in `memories/preferences.md` — confirm the verdict with a fresh query, don't recall it.)

## Post in-chat feedback to the PR

When the user gives feedback, corrections, or guidance in the CLI or chat while working a PR, paraphrase it and post it as a PR comment:

```
gh pr comment <N> --body "..."
```

One to three sentences is enough.
Don't quote verbatim — paraphrase so it reads naturally in the PR thread.
Skip trivial acknowledgments or conversational exchanges with nothing to act on.

This makes context visible to future @claude sessions, other reviewers, and contributors who only see the PR thread.

## Subscribe to PR updates automatically

When opening or taking over a PR in any repo, subscribe/watch that PR's activity immediately using the available GitHub notification/subscription mechanism. If the current session's tools cannot subscribe, say so explicitly and fall back to active polling for reviews, comments, and checks during the session.

## Monitor every pushed PR head to completion

After every push to a PR in every repository and every session, actively monitor that exact head commit for CI failures and new review comments.
Keep polling and address actionable failures or findings until all workflows and check runs are complete and passing (success or skipped), the current-head review is clean, and no review threads remain unresolved.
Once that commit is fully clean and green, stop the **intensive head poll** for it; don't restart that poll for the same commit unless something regresses.
A later push creates a new head commit and starts a new monitoring cycle automatically.

**Ending the head poll does not end the PR watch.**
The two run at different frequencies and answer different questions, and only the first one is finished when a head goes green:

- The **head poll** asks "is this commit done?" and terminates when it is.
- The **PR watch** above ("Subscribe to PR updates automatically") asks "is this PR still mergeable and still clean?" and runs until the PR merges or closes.

That distinction is load-bearing because a clean head can regress with **no push of yours at all**.
The base branch advancing is enough: the PR goes `CONFLICTING`, or `main` catches up to an R package's `DESCRIPTION` version, or a sibling PR merges a colliding append --- each turning a green, review-clean head red while nothing about that commit changed.
`shared/workflow/fully-clean.md` says the same thing about verdicts: a clean CI run and a clean review are a snapshot, not a standing guarantee.

So keep checking mergeability and check state at the lower PR-watch frequency after the head poll ends, and **restart the intensive poll if state regresses** --- a new conflict, a check flipping red, a fresh review comment.
Re-derive it from a live query rather than trusting the earlier verdict.

## Claim a GitHub PR/issue before working on it

@shared/workflow/claim-pr.md

The `claim-pr` skill operationalizes this (the exact claim wording, when it applies, and the closing/unclaim comment).

## Open a PR immediately after claiming an issue

@shared/workflow/pr-on-claim.md

The strong form of the claim: after claiming an issue you're about to work, open the PR right away — before implementing — from an empty commit, kept as a draft until the implementation lands.
An open PR is the visible in-flight signal other sessions check, so opening it up front stops parallel duplicates.
The `gi`, `gii`, `gip`, and `st` skills operationalize this.

## Open a PR for every pushed feature branch

After pushing a feature branch, create its PR
unless an existing PR already represents that branch
or the user explicitly says not to.
Don't treat a successful push as the handoff:
the PR is the reviewable unit and the durable visible record of the work.

## Use the existing PR branch, not the harness-specified branch

The Claude Code on the web harness injects a "Git Development Branch Requirements" section that assigns a session-unique branch name (e.g. `claude/abc123`) as the default for each repo.
**That branch is a fallback for brand-new work with no existing PR.**

When a task involves an existing PR or branch, work on that PR's branch instead:

1. Find the branch name: call `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`method: get`) or (in CLI sessions) `gh pr view <N> --json headRefName -q .headRefName`.
2. Check it out or create a worktree from `origin/<branch>`.
3. Push back to that branch and update the existing PR --- do not open a new one.

Use the harness-specified branch only when starting work with no existing PR and no existing branch to continue.

**Treat a PR-preview URL as an explicit PR target.**
If the user points to a page under a path like
`.../pr-preview/pr-436/...`,
interpret that as "work on PR #436" by default:
check out that PR's branch,
push updates to it,
and update that same PR.
Do not open a separate PR unless the user explicitly asks for one.

**Exception --- the session can only push to its own branch.** Some web/remote sessions are scoped so the agent proxy allows pushing *only* to the harness-assigned branch; a push to any other branch (the existing PR's branch included) is rejected with `HTTP 403`.
When that happens you cannot follow step 3.
Don't retry the 403 --- it's a policy denial, not a transient error.

**Prefer stacking the fix, not superseding the PR.** When the work is an incremental fix to an existing, still-open PR (a review finding, a small addition) rather than a full rebuild, push the fix to the assigned branch and open it as a PR **stacked on** the original --- `base` set to the original PR's own branch, per the [`stack-prs`](skills/stack-prs/SKILL.md) skill --- rather than superseding it. Comment on the original PR pointing to the stacked one, and note the dependency ("stacked on this branch — either merge #N into this branch first, or merge this PR and #N will retarget to `main`"). This keeps the diff to just the incremental change instead of re-litigating the whole original PR's content, and it composes correctly regardless of how the maintainer merges it: they can merge the stacked PR straight into the original's branch (folding the fix in before the original PR itself merges) or merge the original first and let the stacked PR retarget to `main` per that skill's step 4.
Reserve the supersede path (below) for when stacking doesn't fit --- the original branch/PR is abandoned, or the fix amounts to a full rebuild rather than an incremental addition.

**A plain `git merge --ff-only` plus push is a second way to fold a stacked PR
into its base, alongside GitHub's own merge button --- and GitHub notices
either way.**
When the stacked PR's branch is a strict superset of its base
(confirm with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <base-tip> <stacked-tip>`),
merging the stacked branch into the base branch locally with `--ff-only` and
pushing moves only a ref, with no new commit created.
GitHub still detects that the stacked PR's head commit is now reachable from
its base, and closes that PR as **merged** on its own, deleting its head
branch if the repo auto-deletes on merge.
This is the same outcome the paragraph above describes for GitHub's merge
button, reached by a different door.

**This is still a merge, bound by the Strict Merge Control Policy below** ---
the same explicit-permission requirement that gates clicking the merge button
applies here too, since the effect on the stacked PR is identical.
Never run this to close a PR on your own initiative.
It also only applies when the base genuinely is another open PR's branch, not
`main` --- the adjacent fact above, that a squash-merged base PR makes GitHub
auto-retarget the stacked PR to `main`, means "its base" can silently become
`main` once the original PR merges.
Fast-forwarding straight into `main` this way would push unreviewed commits
to the default branch, bypassing PR review and required checks entirely.

Verify the superset relationship before relying on this, and prefer
`--ff-only` specifically --- it refuses outright, rather than silently
creating a new, unreviewed merge commit on the base branch, if the two
branches have actually diverged.
Confirm the auto-close afterward with `gh pr view <stacked-N> --json
state,mergeCommit`; a `state: MERGED` with `mergeCommit.oid` equal to the
commit you just pushed confirms the fast-forward was picked up.
(`UCD-SERG/serocalculator#547` -> `#545`, 2026-08-08: `git merge
origin/claude/pr-545-fix-h4gclq --ff-only` in `#545`'s worktree, followed by a
push, left both branches at commit `6a6f83c0d`; GitHub closed `#547` as merged
and deleted its head branch within the same push --- done with the user's
explicit go-ahead on the underlying architectural decision.)

**Supersede fallback, when stacking doesn't apply:** push the fix to the assigned branch, open a **new** PR off `main` that supersedes the original (say "Supersedes #N" in the body and rebuild as a single clean commit so no sensitive history leaks through), comment on the original PR pointing to the replacement, and close the original once the new PR merges.

**Rebuilding the single clean commit: diff against `main`, don't cherry-pick from the write-protected branch.** `main` usually doesn't yet contain the original PR's changes, so cherry-picking just your incremental fix commit conflicts --- it was written against the PR branch's state, not `main`'s.
Instead, diff the whole file set and apply it fresh:
```bash
git diff origin/main <old-branch> -- <changed-files> > /tmp/rebuild.diff
git checkout -B <assigned-branch> origin/main
git apply /tmp/rebuild.diff
git add <changed-files> && git commit -m "..." && git push -u origin <assigned-branch>
```
(Seen on ai-config#372 → #380: the assigned branch could push, `sync-freshness-rule` could not.)

**Check whether the branch's own PR merged before adding more commits to it.** If a PR on this branch merged via **squash** (common in repos that enforce it), the branch's old commits are no longer ancestors of `main`'s new tip — `git merge-base --is-ancestor <old-commit> origin/main` returns false.
Committing follow-up work on top of that stale branch and pushing looks fine locally, but the resulting PR's diff shows the *entire prior PR's changes again* against `main`, confusing reviewers and re-litigating already-merged content.
Before adding commits to a branch you didn't just create, fetch `origin/main` and check ancestry first.
If the branch's own PR already merged, don't build on top of it — start clean: `git checkout -b <branch> origin/main`, then `git cherry-pick` only the genuinely new commit(s).
If you've already pushed a bloated diff, the same fix applies retroactively: rebuild the branch from `origin/main` plus a cherry-pick of the new work, then `git push --force-with-lease`. (Seen on gha#161 → gha#162 and ai-config#344 → ai-config#354, both squash-merged.)

**A stacked PR reaches that bloated state with no push of yours at all, and it announces itself as a merge conflict.**
The rule above is written around an action you take: you add commits to a stale branch, so the check fires when you are about to commit.
A PR stacked on another PR's branch needs nothing from you.
When the base PR squash-merges, GitHub **auto-retargets** the stacked PR to `main`.
The same orphaning then happens retroactively, to a branch that has been sitting untouched.

What makes it worth its own entry is the symptom.
The bloat presents as `mergeable_state: dirty` --- a conflict --- which invites conflict resolution.
Resolving those conflicts would mean re-litigating already-merged content line by line.
The diff and commit count are the tell that it is not a real conflict:

| | before the base merged | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mergeable_state` | `clean` | `dirty` |
| diff | `+82/-0` | `+122/-0` |
| commits | 2 | 9 |

So when a stacked PR goes dirty, check ancestry before touching the conflicts.
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <base-PR-commit> origin/main` returning false means the base squash-merged, and the fix is the rebuild above rather than a merge.
Confirm the base PR's content is genuinely on `main` first, since that is what makes discarding those commits safe.
Normalize whitespace and backticks when you check (`git show origin/main:<path>`), because this corpus breaks lines mid-phrase.

**A live variant of the same check: the human can merge the branch's PR out from under an in-flight push, not just leave a stale branch to discover later.**
Pushing a commit right as its own PR merges lands in a race in repos that auto-delete head branches on merge: GitHub deletes the head branch, and the in-flight push silently recreates it under the same name --- but now as a brand-new, orphaned branch with no PR, built on top of commits that (for a real merge commit, unlike the squash case above) *are* ancestors of `main`'s new tip.
`git status`/`git push` report success --- but the push is not quite silent, and its one tell is worth knowing, because it fires at the moment of the race rather than hours later.
A push onto a branch that still exists prints a SHA range (`f7bf71f..899e5de <branch> -> <branch>`);
a push that *recreates* a deleted branch prints `* [new branch] <branch> -> <branch>` instead.
Seeing `* [new branch]` for a branch you have already been pushing to means the remote branch was deleted underneath you, which on a PR branch means the PR merged.
Read the push output rather than only its exit status, and run the ancestry check immediately when that line appears.
Recovery is the same ancestry check as above (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch-tip> origin/main`), then cherry-pick the orphaned commit onto a fresh branch off the new `origin/main`;
note that this check's *answer* depends on the repo's merge strategy and so is not itself the signal --- it comes back true where the PR merged as a real merge commit (the serocalculator case in [`CLAUDE.cases.md`](CLAUDE.cases.md)) and false in a squash-merge repo, where `main` carries a new single commit your branch never saw.
Either answer leaves the recovery the same, and in the squash case the orphaned commit is genuinely absent from `main`, so check whether its content actually landed (`git show origin/main:<path> | grep`) rather than inferring it from the merge notification;
delete the stray local and (if push-permitted) remote branch.
If the orphaned commit is genuinely new work --- not a fix that belongs in the now-merged PR --- treat this as the natural start of a new, stacked issue + PR rather than trying to reopen or append to the merged one.

**That tell's precondition is a repo setting, so check the setting rather than
assuming it in either direction --- and a branch that still resolves after your
own late push cannot tell you what the setting is.**
The paragraph above names its precondition, "in repos that auto-delete head
branches on merge", and never says how to find out whether it holds.
Here it holds.
`Morrison-Lab/ai-config` does delete merged head branches, so the tell was
available and the push that followed the merge did print it.
What failed was not the signal.

The evidence that looks like it settles the question is the one that cannot.
After a late push to an already-merged PR's branch, `git ls-remote` resolves
that branch under both hypotheses: the branch was never deleted, or it was
deleted at merge and your own push recreated it.
Both end with the branch present at the pushed commit, so a resolving ref is a
true observation that answers neither hypothesis, and reading it as "this repo
keeps merged head branches" reads a settled fact out of evidence that does not
discriminate.

Two checks do discriminate, and both are cheap.
Other merged PRs' head branches, which no late push has touched, either resolve
or do not.
And the PR's own timeline records the deletion in as many words, since GitHub
logs an auto-delete the same way it logs a manual one.

What is genuinely narrower here than in the paragraph above is the **trigger**,
not the tell.
There the push is concurrent with the merge, so the race is the thing you are
already watching for.
Here minutes had passed and the PR's state had not been re-read since the
review, so nothing prompted a look at the push output at all.
The "Check whether the branch's own PR merged before adding more commits to it"
rule earlier in this section has the same gap: "a branch you didn't just
create" reads as inapplicable on a branch you have been driving continuously
all session, which is exactly the branch this happens on.

Do not reach for that rule's ancestry check as the alternative, though.
This repo squash-merges, and `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch-tip>
origin/main` returns non-ancestor for an **open** PR's branch too, whose
commits do not reach `main` until the squash.
Measured both ways: the orphaned commit below and this entry's own branch while
its PR was open each came back non-ancestor.
So the check cannot separate "still open" from "just merged", which is the
paragraph above's own warning that its answer depends on the merge strategy and
so is not itself the signal.
Re-reading the PR's `merged` field and `head.sha` is what discriminates.

What the failure costs is a claim rather than a commit.
The fix lands on a real remote branch attached to nothing, so the inline thread
gets resolved against a commit that never reached `main`, and the round's
status reads "finding Addressed, thread resolved" when that is true of a branch
and false of the PR.
This is the shape [`ardi`](shared/workflow/ardi.md)'s "a fix is not 'pushed'
until it is on the PR's head commit" bullet describes, one step further out:
there the fix never left the working tree, here it reached a remote branch that
was no longer attached to a PR.

- **Do:** re-read the PR's `merged` field and `head.sha` immediately before
  pushing a fix to a branch whose PR you have not re-read this round.
- **Do:** read `git push`'s own output on that push, and treat `* [new branch]`
  on a branch you have been pushing to as the PR having merged.
- **Do:** settle whether a repo deletes merged head branches from other merged
  PRs' branches, or from the PR's timeline, before concluding that a tell was
  unavailable.
- **Don't:** read a branch that still resolves after your own late push as
  evidence it was never deleted; the push recreated it.
- **Don't:** substitute the ancestry check for re-reading the PR's state in a
  squash-merge repo, where it returns non-ancestor for an open PR too.
- **Don't:** report a finding as Addressed on the strength of a pushed commit
  without checking which ref that commit is reachable from.

**The harness-assigned branch name itself can already exist locally, pointing at unrelated stale content from an earlier session in the same container.**
A fresh container doesn't guarantee a fresh local branch state --- `git checkout -b <harness-branch> origin/<existing-PR-branch>` can fail with "a branch named `<harness-branch>` already exists" if a prior session in this container created one under that same name and left it pointing at old work.
Don't assume it's safe to reuse or that it reflects the actual PR: check `git merge-base --is-ancestor <local-tip> origin/main` first --- if the local tip is already an ancestor of `main` (i.e. it was old, already-merged content, not in-flight work), it's safe to discard by force-checking out the real PR branch under that same name with `git checkout -B <harness-branch> origin/<existing-PR-branch>` (uppercase `-B` resets the branch in place instead of erroring).

**A PR whose head branch lives in a different repo entirely (not just a scope-restricted push) always needs the supersede path --- there's no fix-in-place option to prefer over it.**
A cross-fork "sync upstream into main" PR --- opened by comparing `<upstream-owner>/<repo>:main` against `<fork-owner>/<repo>:main` --- has its head ref owned by the upstream repo, not the fork.
When that PR shows a real conflict (`mergeable_state: dirty`), the fork has no push access to the head branch at all, regardless of what the harness's own push-scope policy allows elsewhere in the session --- so the stacking preference above doesn't apply here;
go straight to superseding.
Fetch both remotes, merge upstream's branch into a fork-local branch off the fork's own `main`, resolve conflicts there, open a same-repo PR ("Supersedes #N" in the body), and close the original once the replacement merges.

## Skills that call gh/glab: fall back to tool-mappings.md in remote sessions

Many skills under `skills/` name concrete `gh`/`glab` CLI commands (e.g. `gh pr comment`, `gh issue create`).
In a remote/web session where `gh`/`glab` isn't on `PATH`, substitute the equivalent GitHub MCP tool from [`tool-mappings.md`](tool-mappings.md) instead of failing or improvising.
That registry is the single source of truth for the gh/glab-to-MCP mapping in this repo --- don't inline a separate translation table into individual skills; point to `tool-mappings.md` and let it stay the one place to update. (GitLab operations have no MCP equivalent listed there; `glab` stays CLI-only.)

## Install and use MCP servers proactively

@shared/workflow/use-mcp-servers.md

The section above is about substituting an MCP tool for a CLI command when the CLI is missing.
This one is the other direction: when a server would help, install and register it rather than waiting to be asked --- including locally, where `tool-mappings.md`'s per-model table describes the default rather than a limit.
Covers reading `claude mcp list` for transport rather than name (a plugin's remote server can shadow the local one you meant), 400-versus-401 on an uninterpolated credential, supplying tokens by launch wrapper instead of storing them, opt-in toolsets whose selection *replaces* the default, and verifying by a real call rather than by the tool listing.
Its last section generalizes past MCP: when a standing rule names a mechanism this session doesn't have, look for the local equivalent instead of silently degrading to a worse fallback.

## File an issue before starting a new task

@shared/workflow/issue-first.md

The `st` (Start Task) skill operationalizes this; `gi` (Grab Issue) is the path when the issue already exists.

## Issue or discussion? Pick the venue by best practice, not by precedent

@shared/workflow/choose-issue-or-discussion.md

The companion to issue-first above: that rule settles *whether* something is tracked before work starts, this one settles *where* it lands.
Actionable work is an issue.
An open-ended policy question whose deliverable is a decision, and which has a real do-nothing option, is a discussion --- in an answerable category (`Q&A`) so the resolution can be marked as the answer.
Its second half is the general principle: best practice outranks repo precedent when choosing venue or method, and "the board is unused, so nobody would find it there" is circular reasoning that can never permit anyone to start using it.

## If you see something, say something — file an issue for every noticed mistake

@shared/workflow/report-mistakes-proactively.md

The proactive counterpart to issue-first above: when a mistake shows up in any medium — code, prose, AI-config files, `gha` workflows, snapshot and other generated files, or anything else — even out of scope for the current task, flag it in chat (`⚠️ FLAG`) and file a tracking issue immediately, in a repo we administrate.
Never file autonomously in an external repo; the upstream-issues ladder governs that case.
The `defer-issue` skill covers the user-initiated version of this; this rule is self-initiated.

## Say when a practice is slipping, not only when an artifact is wrong

@shared/workflow/flag-practice-slippage.md

The counterpart to the rule above, for *practice* rather than for artifacts: that one governs a mistake in a thing and its deliverable is a filed issue, this one governs how the work is being done and its deliverable is one sentence at the moment it is actionable.
The outward direction is already covered by the review fragments and needs no restatement.
The two that need stating are inward, unprompted and outside any review loop, and **upward** --- telling me when *my* practice is slipping, which will not happen by default because deference costs nothing at the moment it is chosen and reads as politeness.
Name the specific practice and gap, cite the rule or label the opinion as an opinion, say it before the action rather than in the retrospective, and say it once --- the decision stays mine, and this is not a licence to relitigate it.

## Learn from every reviewer finding you accept, not only from your own admissions

@shared/workflow/learn-from-review-findings.md

The external-correction counterpart to the UMS triggers at the top of this file: those fire on a first-person admission ("I was wrong"), which is why `hooks/remind-ums-after-error.py` deliberately excludes correcting someone else.
Agreeing with a reviewer is the commoner case and the one that machinery misses --- you admit nothing, you accept a finding --- so an accepted finding is a first-push miss to record and, where a decidable condition exists, to algorithmatize, per the goal that every PR gets a clean review on the first push.
`hooks/remind-learn-from-review.py` is that trigger; like its sibling it only ever adds context and never blocks, and it stays unregistered until its PR merges, per README's activation gate.

## Tracking issues in upstream repos

@shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md

The `sup` / `send-upstream` skill operationalizes steps 1--2 (the PR path, including fork-if-needed, and the issue path) and the link-back.
Step 3 (own-repo fallback) is not covered by `sup`; use `gh issue create` in the current repo and ask the user to transfer it.

## Wrap up a merged PR with UMS

When a PR/MR you were working on **merges**, run the `post-merge` skill: verify the merge actually landed, tidy the local branch (checkout `main`, pull, `git branch -d`), confirm any deferred items have follow-up issues, then run **UMS** to capture what the PR's review lifecycle taught — recurring review findings, corrections, and guidance given along the way.
A merge is the natural checkpoint to bank lessons before the context is lost.

This is not the *first* checkpoint, though, and it should rarely be the one carrying the whole backlog.
Per "Run UMS proactively" above, the pass already ran when the review verdict came back clean, so `post-merge`'s UMS covers what the merge itself taught -- a conflict resolved on the way in, a check that only fires on `main`, a squash that reshaped the history.
Run it regardless: a short pass that finds nothing new is the expected outcome when the verdict-time pass did its job, not a reason to skip the step.

"merge it" / "merge this" / "merge the PR" as bare directives (no slash) trigger the `merge-it` skill: when the PR isn't merged yet, it merges the ready PR (squash by default) **then** chains straight into `post-merge` (tidy + UMS); when the PR is already merged it goes directly to `post-merge`.
Either way the post-merge wrap-up — including the UMS follow-up PR — runs **automatically, without asking**.
If the phrase is clearly part of ordinary prose rather than a standalone directive, treat it as such.

## What "fully clean" means

@shared/workflow/fully-clean.md

Escalate a deadlock via the `request-pr-review` skill (human reviewer `d-morrison`, or `gh pr edit <N> --add-reviewer d-morrison`), and surface the open item to me.

## Always run ARDI on PRs you touch

@shared/workflow/ardi.md

The `ardi` / `iterate` skill family runs this loop. (See *What "fully clean" means* above; the mechanics for each step are in the sections around here.)

## Do the review yourself when the @claude workflow doesn't produce a verdict

When a PR you're managing has its `@claude` review workflow fail to produce a usable verdict — whether because it was **skipped for quota** or because it **ran to completion but never stated a verdict** (a "stub review") — don't stall the ARDI loop waiting for it — **do the review yourself and post it** as a PR comment.
Apply the same review standards the bot would (the SERG lab manual and d-morrison's modular/idiomatic priorities), then keep iterating to fully-clean on your own findings.
Neither failure mode is an approval — an unreviewed PR stays unreviewed regardless of why the bot didn't weigh in.

**Quota-skipped:** surfaces as a bot comment — either `Claude review skipped — API quota exhausted` (the review workflow) or `You've hit your org's monthly spend limit` (the `@claude` agent workflow).
Both mean no bot will respond on this run; re-running the workflow only helps once the quota actually resets.

**Stub review:** the review job reports success (`is_error: false`, real cost/turns logged) but the posted comment never states a `### Verdict` --- the run genuinely executed but got cut short before reaching a conclusion (e.g. by escalating permission denials on tool calls it needed).
This looks superficially fine (green check, a comment exists) so it's easy to mistake for a real review --- read the comment body for an actual verdict section before trusting it.
Re-running the same workflow can reproduce the same stub pattern repeatedly rather than self-resolving;
if a retry doesn't help within a round or two, treat it as this failure mode and self-review rather than continuing to re-trigger.

**No review workflow configured at all is a third failure mode, and the one nothing signals on its own.**
Quota-skipped and a stub review both require a review workflow to exist and attempt to run.
Some repos have none: no `@claude` job wired into CI at all, so there is nothing to time out, quota-skip, or stub.
CI stays green because it never ran anything meant to notice, and the PR/MR simply accrues zero review comments.

Check for this once per repo, right after the first push, rather than waiting to notice its absence: grep the repo's own CI config for the review job or template it would come from (a GitHub Actions workflow file, or a GitLab `.gitlab-ci.yml`'s `include:` list) rather than assuming a sibling or template repo's setup carried over.
Treat "not configured" the same as the other two failure modes: self-review immediately, held to the same fact-check rigor "A fallback self-review is prone to being shallow, so hold it to the same bar as the bot it stands in for" requires (fact-check-prose, the cause check, the cited-source rule).
Because a genuine config gap is a standing property of the repo rather than a one-off outage, also file a tracking issue on it per [`report-mistakes-proactively`](shared/workflow/report-mistakes-proactively.md) --- wiring up review coverage is worth fixing, not just working around on every push.

**Post the self-review before doing anything else --- don't stall the PR waiting for the bot.
Then, before writing the check off as permanently broken, try one manual re-run of the failed job --- even after the workflow's own built-in same-run retry (e.g. gha#185's stub-retry) also stubbed.**
Two stubs back to back is a stronger signal than one, but it's still not conclusive: a separately-triggered re-run (`rerun_failed_jobs` via the GitHub Actions API/MCP tool, not just re-reading the same run) is an independent LLM invocation, and the failure modes behind stubs (permission-denial spirals, timing) don't always repeat.
If the check is a **required** one, spend the one manual re-run before reporting the workflow as broken for that PR.

Either way: don't wait on the bot indefinitely — do the review yourself and keep driving to fully-clean.

**Self-review is the immediate fallback so the PR never stalls --
but declaring the PR clean still requires an external verdict whenever one is reachable.**
Don't wait to self-review: post it right away, same as above.
But also check, the same round, whether a *different* configured reviewer is reachable
(e.g. Copilot code review, if the repo/org has it) --
not just whether the `@claude` bot specifically produced a verdict,
since the two can fail independently (one quota-exhausted, the other working fine, or vice versa) --
and request it in parallel with posting the self-review, not after.
Re-check reachability every round:
a reviewer that was ineligible/quota-exhausted a few pushes ago (a missing license, a temporary rate limit)
can become reachable mid-session.
Before reporting a PR **fully clean** / **ready** (ARDI's own terminal-state terms -- see `fully-clean.md`),
confirm a genuine all-clear review is posted at the current head from an external reviewer, if one is reachable --
a self-review alone, or a clean state you inferred yourself from green CI and resolved threads,
doesn't satisfy this once an external verdict is obtainable.

**A fallback self-review is prone to being shallow, so hold it to the same bar as the bot it stands in for.**
A self-review you post *because* the automated reviewer was unavailable --- quota-skipped, a stub, or erroring on an infra failure --- feels like a stopgap rather than the real review, so it tends to get a shallower pass than the round deserves.
The gap is specific and predictable: a shallow self-review checks *structure* --- a dogfood back-reference, ASCII punctuation, semantic line breaks --- and skips the prose *fact-check*, so a false mechanism claim or a misattributed citation sails straight through, since a structural pass has nothing to say about either.
Run the applicable prose-review skills against the diff's own factual claims, not just its shape: [`fact-check-prose`](shared/writing/fact-check-prose.md), the **cause** claim-type check in [`metacognitive-monitoring`](shared/workflow/metacognitive-monitoring.md), and the read-the-cited-source rule in [`address-every-comment`](shared/workflow/address-every-comment.md) --- a claim about *why* some mechanism behaves as it does gets asked what else would explain it, and a citation gets read against what the cited source actually says.
This is the fallback-specific sharpening of "Apply the same review standards the bot would" above: the standard does not relax because the reviewer it replaces happened to be absent.

- **Do:** run `fact-check-prose`, the **cause** check, and the cited-source check on a fallback self-review, exactly as on any pre-push self-review.
- **Do:** treat the fallback's stopgap feel as the cue to slow down, not as license to skip the semantic checks.
- **Don't:** let a fallback self-review stop at structural checks (dogfood, ASCII, line breaks) and report "no findings".
- **Don't:** read "the bot was down" as permission for a lighter review than the bot itself would have given.

## Watch and ARDI every PR you touch — don't ask first

When you open (or are handed) a PR/MR in **any** repo, subscribe to its activity and run the ARDI loop to clean **automatically** — never ask "should I watch this?" or "should I iterate it?" first.
That answer is a standing yes across all PRs and all repos.
Subscribe with the `subscribe_pr_activity` tool (provided by the GitHub MCP server in remote/web sessions) or babysit locally, drive every review round to fully-clean, and re-arm a periodic check-in since webhooks don't deliver CI-success or merge-conflict transitions.

This webhook-driven loop never formally invokes the `ardi` skill, so read `skills/ardi/SKILL.md` step 6 for the re-request-review mechanics before pushing a fix: after a push, the push itself already triggers the review — don't also post "@claude review again" in the same round.
On workflows with `concurrency: cancel-in-progress`, the two triggers race and cancel each other, leaving the latest commit's review canceled and `require-review` red for no code reason.
Only post the mention when a round pushed no code (all Rebut/Defer).

Surface to me only when an item is ambiguous, architecturally significant, or deadlocked (the escalation rule above still applies), or when the PR is clean.
Stop watching only when the PR merges or closes, or I tell you to back off.

## Babysit PRs efficiently — batch pushes, trust CI's own reports, skip redundant lookups

@shared/workflow/efficient-pr-babysitting.md

A long babysitting session accumulates avoidable tool calls and CI runs otherwise:
trickled single-item pushes each re-trigger CI and race each other's reviews,
a local re-run can rediscover a gap CI's own comment already named,
and a pure re-post webhook event doesn't need fresh analysis.

## Address every in-scope review comment, even non-blockers

@shared/workflow/address-every-comment.md

If you and the reviewer reach an impasse on a single item (your rebuttal didn't convince them and their re-raise didn't convince you), escalate that item to a **human reviewer** — request `d-morrison` via the `request-pr-review` skill (or `gh pr edit <N> --add-reviewer d-morrison`) and `@`-mention them with the impasse — for the final call rather than looping.

## Keep PR branches synced with main

@shared/workflow/sync-with-main.md

(Another instance of **never assume; always verify** — `git fetch` to check main's actual position instead of assuming the branch is current.
The `sync-pr-branch` / `merge-main` skill runs this.)

## Batch merge and resolve, always

The section above is one branch against `main`.
When **several** open PRs need syncing or conflict resolution, do them together in one pass rather than chasing each one's conflict flag as it appears.
The batch pass is the default, not a recovery step for when serial chasing has already failed.

@shared/workflow/batch-merge-and-resolve.md

The key points, restated here because a bare pointer is invisible to a consumer that doesn't load the fragment:

- **Serial chasing cannot converge when the base's merge interval is shorter than a review round.**
  Both are measurable, so compare them rather than judging: `git log origin/main --first-parent -10 --format='%ct'` for the merge rate, and the review check's own `startedAt`/`completedAt` for the round.
  Count **first-parent** commits, not merge commits --- `git log --merges` reports nothing in a squash-merging repo.
- **A `DIRTY` flag means stale or defective, and only the second is a defect.**
  A PR whose content is clean but whose base moved is stale rather than broken.
  Staleness resolves once, at merge time, so re-syncing it eagerly spends a CI cycle and a review round on a state that expires within one merge interval.
- **A conflict your sweep found is not a conflict your merge caused.**
  Attribution is a second axis, and it runs before the claim: intersect the merge's own deleted and renamed paths (`git diff --name-status -M "$merge^1" "$merge" | grep -E '^(D|R)'`) with each conflict, and report conflicts caused alongside conflicts found.
  `git show --name-status <merge>` cannot supply that set for a **true** (two-parent) merge --- it prints no file list at all there, and grepping its header for `^[ADMR]` returns three phantom paths.
  It does diff a squash merge normally, so whether it works depends on how the repo merges rather than on the commit in front of you.
  A conflict you caused on a branch you do not own is an explanatory comment, not a push.
- **Independent per-PR checking cannot see pair collisions.**
  Every PR can be clean against `main` while two of them conflict with each other.
  Only a pairwise `git merge-tree` between PR heads finds that.
- **Any sweep needs a negative control**, run first.
  A zero matrix is indistinguishable from a detector that never ran, and `merge-tree` has two ways of producing one: the legacy three-arg form always exits 0, and its conflict markers are diff-indented, so `grep '^<<<<<<<'` misses them.
  Report how many pairs were examined, not only how many conflicted.
- **`merge=union` raises the stakes rather than lowering them**, since it resolves append collisions with no conflict to review.
- **"No conflict" is not an all-clear.**
  Version parity and Markdown list-item splices both arrive through cleanly-resolved merges with nothing red to point at.
  The transferable lesson: when a defect can be introduced by **deleting** a line, any instrument keyed on added lines is unsound for it --- use a count delta across the merge instead.

## Move referenced assets along with content that migrates or gets removed

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/migrate-referenced-assets.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/migrate-referenced-assets.md

## Prioritize internal infrastructure work slightly over feature work

@shared/workflow/pr-prioritization.md

A tie-breaker for `ardia`'s PR-ordering step and `gi`'s (and `gii`/`gip`'s) issue-priority table when candidates are otherwise close in priority.
The fragment also sets the default direction for the age factor: among several open PRs, take the **older** one first unless you have more specific instructions.

## Use subagents when helpful --- and delegate rather than queue

When available, use subagents for helpful sidecar work: independent investigation, verification, or disjoint implementation slices.
Keep immediate blocking critical-path edits local so progress does not wait unnecessarily.

**Nothing parallelizable should ever sit "queued."**
Work that does not block the edit in front of you is, by definition, work another agent could already be doing.
Deferring it buys nothing: the serial version finishes no sooner, and the deferred item is the one most likely to be dropped outright when the session ends or the context turns over.

The tell is a phrase, which makes it cheap to catch, because you have to type it before the mistake is complete.
Writing "queued", "next up", "after this", or "I will do that next" into a status recap is the signal that a subagent should already have been running on that item.
Treat the urge to write the word as the trigger to launch, not as an acceptable way to describe the plan.

**Sidecar delegation is pre-authorized, so it is never worth asking about.**
Independent investigation, verification, a disjoint implementation slice, an owed UMS pass, a routed `cai` --- all of these are standing grants.
This section is the user instruction that settles it, so a harness default of the form "do not call the Agent tool unless the user requested it" is already satisfied: the request is here, standing, and does not need restating each session.
Asking anyway costs a round trip and returns the answer already written down.

- **Do:** launch the subagent at the moment you would otherwise have typed "queued", and say in the recap what it is working on.
- **Do:** treat an owed UMS pass or a routed `cai` as delegable sidecar work rather than as a wrap-up step to reach later.
- **Don't:** report an item as queued, next up, or deferred to later in the session when nothing actually blocks it.
- **Don't:** wait for a per-session request before delegating, or ask whether to use a subagent.
- **Don't:** hand off the blocking edit itself --- the critical-path change stays local, so progress never waits on a round trip.

**"I owe you X" is a tell, not a status, and it is the one that evades the tells above.**
Those all describe a *plan*: queued, next up, after this.
This family describes a *debt already acknowledged to the user*: "I owe", "still owe", "I'll get to", "on my list", "pending on my side".
Naming what you owe someone reads as accountability rather than as deferral, so it feels like the diligent thing to write, and the work stays parked exactly the same.

The phrase reports work that has already been identified and scoped, which is what makes it a dispatch signal.
If it is well enough specified to be described as owed, it is well enough specified to brief a subagent with.
That is the whole test: could you write a self-contained brief?
If you can, you should have.

The asymmetry is what makes this a rule rather than a reminder.
Work parked in my own queue is invisible to the user, competes with the live task for attention, and is lost outright when the session ends.
Work handed to a subagent is none of those three.
The limit is the mirror of that test: work that genuinely depends on this conversation's context, or a single edit cheaper to make than to describe, is not worth dispatching.

**Research and reading are dispatchable by default, and the test is the size of the comprehension rather than the size of the fetch.**
One call that returns something you then have to understand, extract from, and synthesize is a task, not an errand.
The miss here is subtler than a deferred to-do, because "I need to read something" does not present as work at all.
It feels like a prerequisite to thinking, so the dispatch question is never asked --- and a category of work that does not present as work cannot be caught by a rule about how to handle work.

This composes with [`research-before-asking`](shared/workflow/research-before-asking.md) rather than competing with it.
That fragment makes reading an obligation before asking a human.
This one makes it delegable once you are doing it.
Neither is licence to skip it.

Note what makes a routing failure hard to catch at all: **it leaves no trace in the artifact**.
The reading can be done correctly and the resulting entry can be sound, so no output, test, or reviewer would reveal anything.
Only asking why the work was routed that way surfaces it.

- **Do:** launch the subagent at the moment you would otherwise have typed "I owe you", and say in the recap what it is working on.
- **Do:** dispatch reading and research whose comprehension is substantial, however small the fetch that starts it.
- **Don't:** report an owed item as a status --- describing it that well is proof the brief already exists.
- **Don't:** apply a "cheaper to do than to brief" test to the fetch when the reading is the actual work.

Distinct from [`when-to-orchestrate`](shared/workflow/when-to-orchestrate.md), which governs the heavier `Workflow` tool.
That rule is a **gate**: a fan-out across four or more verification-bearing targets is a real spend, so it has to be opted into or proposed with a cost estimate.
This one is a **grant**: a single `Agent` call covering one sidecar task is cheap, needs no opt-in, and the cost it prevents is an idle parallel track rather than an overspend.
So when a task clears that fragment's three-part bar, follow it and propose the workflow; everything below that bar is a subagent to launch now.

## Derive a set of work items; never hand over an enumeration of it

The section above governs *whether* to dispatch.
This governs how to **scope** what you dispatch.
A brief that lists PR or issue numbers is a snapshot, stale the moment it is written.
Before dispatching work scoped to a list, ask whether that set can grow or change while the work runs.
When it can, hand over the query that derives it rather than the list itself.

The failure is invisible by construction, which is why it needs a rule rather than more care.
Every agent does its job correctly on the list it was given, so the items that appear *between* the lists are covered by nobody, and no artifact reports it --- coverage is a property of the set rather than of any member.
`scripts/pr-sweep.py` is the deterministic half for open PRs, and reports what it examined rather than only what it found.

@shared/workflow/derive-dont-enumerate.md

## Subagent worktrees are assigned, and an incident never silently repeals a decision

Two rules, one incident, and the second is the general form of the first.

**Assign the worktree on the `Agent` call.** Set `isolation` yourself rather than leaving each subagent to organize its own working directory, and brief every agent you isolate to stay inside the worktree it was given and to **push early** --- a pushed commit survives anything that happens to a working tree.
Deciding that a particular agent does not need one is fine.
Leaving it unmarked is what is not.
`hooks/flag-unassigned-worktree.py` mechanizes exactly this, and warns rather than blocks.

**"Stay inside the worktree it was given" holds only while the agent works in the session's own repo.**
`isolation: "worktree"` places that worktree in the **session's primary repository**, never in a repository the brief happens to name --- so a dispatch into a different clone hands the agent a worktree of the wrong repo, and the instruction above is unfollowable as written.
Name the target clone by path instead, and tell the agent to create its own worktree there off `origin/<default-branch>` --- resolved from that repo, never hard-coded, per `memories/preferences.md`'s measured `fatal: invalid reference: origin/main` failure on a repo whose default is named otherwise.
Measured 2026-08-07.
[`memories/git-worktrees.md`](memories/git-worktrees.md) carries the evidence.
[`shared/workflow/challenge-the-assignment.md`](shared/workflow/challenge-the-assignment.md) covers the general form --- a brief must not assert anything about the recipient's environment, which the author cannot query even in principle.

**The general rule is the more valuable half.** When an incident makes you stop doing something you had decided to do, either re-argue the decision explicitly or fix the misuse --- never just change the behaviour.
A repealed decision changes no artifact, so review, tests, and hooks are all blind to it by construction, and the only detector is someone who remembers.
It is more dangerous than ordinary drift because the incident supplies an apparent reason, so from the inside it feels like having learned something rather than like lapsing.
If you cannot point at the message where a decision was reversed, it was not reversed.
It lapsed.

@shared/workflow/incidents-dont-repeal-decisions.md

## Non-destructive repo and memory actions

The user gives general permission to proceed with non-destructive actions such as setting up PRs, reading GitHub repository data through the API, running non-destructive Git and Perl commands, and editing shared `CLAUDE.md` memory. This includes pushing branches and opening PRs against the ai-config repo. Default to action without confirmation for reasonable non-destructive steps; ask only for destructive, ambiguous high-impact, or genuinely blocking choices. Destructive operations still require explicit instruction.

## Auto-orchestration: always look for Workflow opportunities

The heavy, parallelizable skills (`ardia`, `ardiaei`, `gia`, `gip`, `grade-work`, `opposition-research`, `find-overlap`) decide on their own whether a task warrants multi-agent orchestration via the `Workflow` tool --- so I don't have to type `ultracode` every time.
The `Workflow` tool stays opt-in-gated for bare prompts; an invoked skill is itself the sanctioned opt-in.
Launch a workflow directly when an opt-in signal is already present (`ultracode`, a `+Nk` budget, or "use a workflow"), otherwise propose one with a one-line cost estimate and wait.
The PR/issue-iteration skills stay serial where pushes collide on shared review runners (see the fragment's shared-runner exception).

More generally --- not just inside the named heavy skills --- always look for opportunities to automate work via the `Workflow` tool.
When a task turns out to be workflow-shaped (decomposable, verification-bearing, and at a scale that earns it --- see the fragment's criteria), say so and propose a workflow even if no skill mandated one.
The same opt-in gate still applies: propose with a cost estimate and wait unless an opt-in signal is already present.

@shared/workflow/when-to-orchestrate.md

## Agent teams: a third parallelism primitive, human-gated and advisory

The corpus governs two primitives a session invokes itself --- a single `Agent` call ("Use subagents when helpful", above) and the `Workflow` tool ("Auto-orchestration", just above).
An **agent team** is the third: several separate Claude Code sessions (a lead plus teammates, each its own context window) that coordinate through a shared task list and a mailbox and **message each other directly**, rather than only reporting back.
Unlike the other two, a session cannot form one on its own, so the corpus's role is only to *recommend* it.

The discriminator across all three is one question: **do the workers need to communicate with each other, or does a human want to steer individual workers mid-run?**
No to both --- a subagent or a `Workflow` sweep, per the rules above.
Yes --- an agent team, and only if it is enabled.

**Never assume a team is available, and never author a step that spawns one.**
Agent teams are experimental and off by default (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`), and are spawned by the *user* in natural language and steered through an interactive agent panel --- not invoked by an autonomous or headless session.
So a recommendation to the user is the only correct output; a skill or `Workflow` step that forms a team is a bug.
The one concrete reuse angle: a `.claude/agents/<name>.md` subagent definition doubles as a teammate role (its `tools` and `model` apply, and its body is appended to the teammate's prompt), but its `skills`/`mcpServers` frontmatter is not applied to a teammate.

@shared/workflow/agent-teams.md

## Algorithmatize checks: instruments over LLM reasoning

Never spend LLM reasoning on a check a deterministic algorithm can decide:
build or run the instrument (a repo script, a CI step, a state dump plus a
threshold) and consume its verdicts, reserving model judgment for the
genuinely semantic remainder.
When you catch yourself (or a reviewer) re-deriving numbers by hand, or
eyeballing an artifact for a property with a numeric definition, that check
wants to be an instrument --- see the fragment for the procedure and tells.

@shared/workflow/algorithmatize-checks.md

## Deterministic tools over model judgment: write yourself out of a job

The section above governs *checks*.
This is the same instinct over the work itself: prefer deterministic,
inspectable algorithms to model reasoning wherever one will serve, and where
none exists, build it.
One principle with two faces, both binding at once --- a **constraint** on the
task in front of you (use the instrument that exists) and a **goal** over time
(build the one that does not, so the constraint gets cheap to obey).
The observable trigger is recurrence: after doing the same judgment task
twice, the third time is a tool.

The argument the checks fragment does not make is **inspectability**.
An algorithm can be read before it runs, reviewed by someone who does not
trust its author, diffed, and re-run to the same answer; model reasoning is
none of those.
That is why a hook beats a rule even when the model would usually follow the
rule.
Applies in every repo, research code included --- a hand-run analysis step or
an eyeballed validation is the same shape as a hand-composed status line.
Design and genuine judgment remain, but as the residue not yet automated
rather than a fixed reserve.

@shared/principles/deterministic-tools.md

## Checklists: Do-Confirm, Read-Do, pause points, killer items

Where a check is mechanical but no instrument can decide it -- because it
spans several unrelated observations at one moment, like a pre-push sweep --
the instrument is a **checklist**, and the same discipline applies.

Add one only where a failure is repeatable, expensive, and mechanically
observable, then get four things right:

- **Type.** *Do-Confirm* (work freely, then stop and confirm) is the default.
  Use *Read-Do* (read each item and perform it in order) only when
  reordering the steps changes the answer, or when a step cannot be undone --
  a merge, a release, session-start freshness.
- **Pause point.** State the moment it fires as an observable event ("before
  `git push`", "before reporting the PR ready"), not a topic.
  A checklist with no trigger is read only by whoever was already careful.
- **Killer items.** Mark the one or two steps most often skipped and most
  costly to skip, since a flat list gets triaged under pressure and the
  dropped item is usually the one that looks like bookkeeping.
  The known ones: the UMS pass ending `post-merge`/`ardi`, and `wrap-up`'s
  state sweep.
- **Length.** Five to nine items, action plus evidence.
  Past that it has started teaching; move the explanation into the prose
  above it.

Treat every checklist as a draft until it has been run on real work, and
treat UMS as its revision loop: when a checklist was followed and the failure
happened anyway, the finding is about the checklist, not only the incident.
Don't checklist-ize skills that are mostly design judgment, exploratory
research, or one-off improvisation.

@shared/workflow/skill-checklists.md

## Never pattern-match blindly: check the purpose transfers

Before reusing a structure --- a template, a working script, a neighbouring
file's shape, a pattern from another tool --- state what the original was
**for** and what the new one is **for**, and confirm those are the same kind
of thing.
Structural fit is necessary and never sufficient.

The tell is that every check you naturally run after adapting a template asks
whether the *mechanism* works, and none asks whether the *purpose* survived
the substitution: same interface, passing tests, and the thing now does the
opposite of what it should.
A template you wrote yourself recently gets the least scrutiny, because
reusing something you just verified feels like consistency rather than like
assuming --- which inverts the scrutiny the situation warrants.
This is not an argument against reuse; it is the check that makes reuse safe.

@shared/workflow/check-purpose-before-reusing.md

## Avoid false dichotomies

When laying out alternatives, test whether they are actually exclusive before
presenting them as such.
The tell is a question posed as either/or and answered with "both" --- which
means the exclusivity was constructed rather than found.

The observable action: before presenting alternatives, state what would be
lost by taking more than one.
If the answer is nothing, they are not alternatives --- enable multi-select,
or present them as composable steps with an order.
Genuinely exclusive options exist (two incompatible designs, a merge strategy,
a name), and presenting those as combinable is its own error; the target is
the unexamined default, not the act of choosing.
Composes with "Present decisions one at a time" above, which governs how many
questions to ask rather than how one question's options relate.

@shared/workflow/avoid-false-dichotomies.md

## Metacognition: monitor claims by type, and distrust the fluent ones

The two rules above supply instruments and checklists for work that is already
recognized as needing checking.
This one covers the assertion that never raised the question --- and the
regulation step nothing prompts.

Monitor your own claims at **composition time**, as each sentence is written,
rather than in a retrospective afterwards.
Confidence cannot be the trigger, because it runs inversely to accuracy, so key
on claim **type** instead: a claim about **state** gets re-queried, one about
**scope** gets checked against the population, one about **cause** gets asked
what else explains it, and an unexamined **default** gets named and decided.
An answer that arrived with no deliberation owes an alternative you can name
and reject.

@shared/workflow/metacognitive-monitoring.md

## Question the assignment, not only the claims

The rule above governs **claims** --- the ones you generate as much as the ones
you are handed.
This one governs what you are asked to **do** --- a brief, an issue body, a
plan, a convention document, or the option set in a posed question.
None of those assert anything, so no claim-checking rule fires on them, and
adopting one feels like compliance rather than like skipping a step.
A wrong claim spoils a sentence; a wrong assignment spoils the whole task,
while every step inside it stays correct and checks green.

Two written lines bound the check: before starting, name the premise the work
rests on and what would show it false; in the report, name one thing in the
assignment you actually checked.
For a posed choice, state what its options presuppose before answering within
them.

It binds the **author** of an assignment too, and that half has no other rule
pointed at it: writing a brief feels like instructing rather than asserting,
so nothing fires on a premise stated inside one.
When a brief you write asserts corpus state --- a file's contents, a rule's
location, a site count --- run the deriving query and paste it beside the
claim, rather than leaving the recipient's discretionary premise check as the
only detector.

## Check for merge conflicts on every merge in an ultracode session

## Big-picture principles: KISS, DRY, DRW, modularity, and friends

Our big-picture principles are cataloged centrally in `shared/principles/` -- the overall dev goals they serve (code and prose that is valid and easy to externally validate, reproducible, highly functional, reliable, secure, efficient, maintainable, extensible, human- and AI-readable, and reusable), each principle's statement (KISS, YAGNI, DRY, DRW, don't incur technical debt, modularity, least astonishment, purity, self-documenting code, fail fast, algorithmatize checks -- plus the reduce/reuse/recycle lens over them), the specific rules and skills that operationalize each, and how the principles relate and trade off.
When encoding a new coding/review rule, file it under the principle it serves (and add a new principle to the catalog when one emerges) rather than leaving either the rule or the principle floating free.

@shared/principles/README.md

## Don't reinvent the wheel (DRW) — in dev and in review

Before implementing a new function or feature, check that it hasn't already been done — in one of our own repos, or in a trustworthy external source we could depend on instead (base R, r-lib, tidyverse, a well-maintained CRAN package).
Prefer forking and/or contributing to an existing external source over re-building the functionality from scratch.
Apply this in review too: a hand-rolled equivalent of functionality that already exists is a review finding, the same weight as any other standing review check.

@shared/principles/dont-reinvent-wheel.md

The `prefer-upstream` skill runs the search; the `prefer-packaged-functions` fragment below is the R-function special case; the `scout-peers` skill gates borrowed code by license.

## Don't incur technical debt

When the right way to do the work in front of you needs a change you have not made yet, make that change as part of the work, rather than shipping the version that routes around it.
The moment debt is incurred is the moment you defer a fix you have **already diagnosed** -- the most defensible-sounding moment there is, because the diagnosis is fresh, the scope argument is genuine, and deferring reads as discipline rather than as a decision.
A filed tracking issue records the debt rather than paying it, and it makes the deferral feel settled in a way an undocumented shortcut never does.
The rule bounds **new** work only: adding a copy to un-migrated code is yours to fix now, the un-migrated code itself is not -- the line is authorship, not adjacency.
Apply this in review too: a diff that adds a second copy of logic the repo already has is a review finding, and a PR that links a follow-up issue for a defect inside its own diff is a stronger one.

@shared/principles/dont-incur-technical-debt.md

The fragment also covers the case where duplicated logic corrupts its own tests -- a test that reimplements the unit under test validates the copy, not the code -- and why this does not conflict with YAGNI.

## Fail fast — no silent failures

Detect bad state early and stop with a clear error rather than proceeding on it; never swallow an error into a silent fallback (a bare `except:`, a `tryCatch` returning `NULL`, a shell `|| true`), and make any genuinely wanted fallback explicit, bounded, and observable.
Apply this in review too: error handling that hides failure is a review finding, the same weight as any other standing review check.

@shared/principles/fail-fast.md

## Coding: KISS is the umbrella principle

Follow the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid) in code and prose alike:
prefer the simplest construct that does the job, and treat added complexity
as a cost that needs justification.
The specific coding rules below --- every fragment under `shared/coding/`,
indexed by the principle it serves in the catalog above --- and the
review-side
`challenge-unnecessary-complexity` policy are special cases of this
principle — they exist because a bare "keep it simple" isn't concretely
reviewable, but when a case arises that none of them covers, apply KISS
directly rather than treating the enumerated rules as exhaustive.

@shared/coding/configurable-parameters.md

## Coding: write tidy code; prefer tidyverse over base R/rlang for it

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/tidy-code.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/tidy-code.md

Apply this both when writing code and when reviewing it — flag base R or
`{rlang}` verbosity in review the same way `per-operation-grouping` flags a
persistent `group_by()` that `.by` would replace.

## Coding: reuse function documentation and argument lists

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/reuse-docs-and-args.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/reuse-docs-and-args.md

## Coding: one function per file

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/one-function-per-file.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/one-function-per-file.md

Apply this both when writing new code and when reviewing it — a new function
added inline to an existing multi-function file is a review finding, the
same weight as the other modularity checks above.

## Coding: no em-dashes or non-ASCII punctuation in source files

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/ascii-punctuation-in-source.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/ascii-punctuation-in-source.md

## Coding: decompose complex code into functions, not .qmd chunks

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/decompose-to-functions.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/decompose-to-functions.md

## Writing style: plain, direct prose

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/writing/plain-prose.md, not here. -->
@shared/writing/plain-prose.md

The `use-preferred-style` skill (alias `style`) spells out the procedure, the PSW chapter links, and a filler/jargon swap table; the `find-ai-tells` skill (alias `ai-tells`) is the scan-after detector counterpart.

## Writing style: semantic line breaks in prose

@shared/writing/semantic-line-breaks.md

## Quarto: link packages on first mention

**Link packages up front.** Package names in `.qmd` prose take the
`[{pkg}](url)` link form on first mention in a section (e.g.
`[{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)`). Add those links as you write the
section — the review bots flag every unlinked package name, one round at a time.

## Quarto: div syntax for figure/table labels and captions

In Quarto `.qmd` files, label and caption figures and tables with **div syntax**, not chunk-option syntax.
Wrap the code chunk in a `::: {#fig-...}` / `::: {#tbl-...}` fenced div and put the caption as the last line before the closing `:::`:

```
::: {#fig-stage-at-dx}

```{r}
#| label: stage-at-dx-fig
#| code-fold: true

plot_stage_at_dx(pt_data)
```

Stage at diagnosis by screening frequency
:::
```

Don't use the chunk options `#| label: fig-...` / `#| fig-cap: "..."` for the cross-reference id and caption.
The div id (`#fig-`/`#tbl-`) carries the cross-reference; the chunk `label` stays a plain code label.
This keeps figures consistent with tables, which already use div syntax.

## Challenge ambiguous phrasing and terminology in review

@shared/workflow/challenge-ambiguous-terminology.md

The `ard`/`ardi` skill family and `use-preferred-style`/`find-ai-tells` operationalize this in their respective review contexts.

## Challenge redundant content in review

@shared/workflow/challenge-redundant-content.md

The `ard`/`ardi` skill family and `code-review` apply this in PR/MR review; `find-overlap` (and its `consolidate-skills`/`consolidate-memory` actors) is the corpus-wide counterpart when redundancy spans more than the current diff.

## Never assert a corpus gap from a grep

The rule above catches redundant content once it is written.
This one catches the belief that produces it: a phrase grep returning nothing is not evidence the corpus lacks a concept, because grep matches strings while coverage is a claim about ideas.
Report the query and its result, not the conclusion.

@shared/workflow/grep-is-not-coverage.md

Fires wherever a search decides whether to author something new --- `skill-builder`'s step 0, `ums`'s step 3, and `find-overlap`, whose own instrument scores this repo's canonical same-idea pair at 0.019 phrase similarity.

## Writing style: scan for AI tells

The detector counterpart to the plain-prose guide above.

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/writing/ai-tells.md, not here. -->
@shared/writing/ai-tells.md

The `find-ai-tells` skill (alias `ai-tells`) runs this same catalog on demand against any target text.

## Writing style: cite sources thoroughly

@shared/writing/citations.md

## Fact-check prose and internal reasoning in review

@shared/writing/fact-check-prose.md

When running `code-review` or the `ard`/`ardi` loop on a diff that touches prose, apply this policy in addition to the normal review — those skills don't name it internally, but this CLAUDE.md directive governs regardless.

## Writing style: timestamp factual claims about conditions that can change

The complement to the fact-check above: a claim can be *true* yet still decay
into a confident falsehood if it's stated as timeless present-tense fact when
its truth is time-dependent (a package's CRAN status, a "current" version, a
count).
Attach the time the claim was true so a later reader knows to
re-verify it.

@shared/writing/timestamp-volatile-claims.md

## Writing style: math derivations — include every step; flag gaps in review

@shared/writing/math-derivation-steps.md

When running `code-review` or the `ard`/`ardi` loop on a diff that touches
math, apply this in addition to the fact-check above.

## Hyperlink technical terms and results; no forward references

@shared/writing/definition-crossrefs.md

Applies wherever `code-review`/`ard`/`ardi` already reviews a prose diff, alongside the fact-check and ambiguous-terminology checks above.

## Remove forward-pointing phrases from prose, not just crossref divs

The section above covers formal Quarto crossref-div ordering for term/result definitions specifically.
The same problem shows up more broadly as plain-text signposting — "as discussed below", "in the following section", "we'll cover this later" — pointing at content the reader hasn't reached yet, in any prose (not just documents with crossref divs).

@shared/writing/forward-references.md

Unlike `definition-crossrefs.md` above, `forward-references.md` has a dedicated actionable skill: the `fix-forward-references` skill (alias `ffr`) detects these with a grep-for-directional-word heuristic and rearranges (or rewords) the prose to fix them.
Run it — or apply its check inline — wherever `ard`/`ardi` reviews a prose diff, alongside the other prose-review rules in this file.

## Detect concepts defined only in prose, never formalized

`definition-crossrefs.md` above assumes a formal-definition div already exists and checks that mentions link to it in the right order.
A distinct, easy-to-miss gap: a concept stated with full definitional precision --- a bolded name, an equation, an `\eqdef` --- that never became a formal div at all, so it has no stable id and nothing downstream can cite it (or the concept rides along inside a *different* definition's div instead of getting its own).

@shared/writing/informal-definitions.md

Like `forward-references.md`, this has a dedicated actionable skill: `detect-informal-definitions`.
Run it --- or apply its check inline --- wherever `ard`/`ardi` reviews a diff that introduces new technical content, alongside the other prose-review rules in this file.

## Detect hypothetical examples where real data is already available

A worked example can be a perfectly well-formed `{#exm-...}` div and still reach for invented, round-number quantities --- "suppose 20% of the exposed group..." --- when the document already loads a real dataset it uses elsewhere.
That's a distinct gap from the informal-definitions check above: it isn't a missing div, it's a missed chance to ground the illustration in real data that was already available.

@shared/writing/hypothetical-examples.md

This has a dedicated actionable skill: `detect-hypothetical-examples`.
Run it --- or apply its check inline --- wherever `ard`/`ardi` reviews a diff that introduces or edits a worked example, alongside the other prose-review rules in this file.
Fixing isn't mechanical substitution: a real dataset's effect size is often much less dramatic than an invented one, so weigh whether the real numbers still make the teaching point before publishing them.

## Fact-check code logic and math in review

<!-- Not yet shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/fact-check-code-logic.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/fact-check-code-logic.md

The code counterpart to the prose fact-check above --- catches strategic
mistakes (wrong algorithm or approach), tactical mistakes (wrong
implementation of a right approach), and math/statistics errors (wrong
formula or method, verified against a source), not just prose claims and
derivations.

## A test fixture is not evidence about the system it imitates

The two fact-check rules above assume you can tell a source from a
non-source.
A test fixture defeats that assumption: it lives in the repo, it is named
after real output, and its own comment often vouches for being verbatim ---
so reasoning from its behaviour back to the real system feels like checking
rather than guessing, and the resulting claim arrives dressed as a test
result.

@shared/workflow/fixtures-are-not-evidence.md

Distinct from `ardi`'s fixture bullets, which are about coverage (a fixture
too thin to reach a branch) rather than about the inference drawn from one
that works fine.

## Challenge unnecessary complexity in review

@shared/workflow/challenge-unnecessary-complexity.md

When running `code-review`, `ard`/`ardi`, or any prose review (`use-preferred-style`, `find-ai-tells`, `fact-check-prose`), apply this alongside the normal review — those skills don't name it internally, so this CLAUDE.md directive governs regardless. It's distinct from `simplify` (a dead-code-after-refactor sweep) and `tidy` (a separate on-demand audit).

## Review with Copilot before requesting human review

This is shared lab guidance on getting an automated review before asking a human reviewer.
When *I* iterate a PR, the ARDI loop above is the mechanism — it already addresses whatever the `@claude` or Copilot reviewer flags — so read this as the lab-member-facing statement of the same principle, not a second loop to run.

## Encoding reusable feedback into ai-config

When the user gives feedback, corrections, or guidance that applies beyond the current session (a standing rule, style preference, workflow change, or behavioral note), decide on your own how to encode it --- don't ask.
Choose the right form (memory bullet in CLAUDE.md, update to a shared fragment in `shared/`, new or revised skill, etc.) and commit the change.
Only surface the choice if it's ambiguous or touches something architecturally significant.

**Put the memory in the repo where it belongs, and don't wait for confirmation to do it.**
Session-local auto-memory is a scratchpad, not a home.
A learning parked there is invisible to every other session and to everyone else, so a reusable one has to land in a version-controlled repo --- `ai-config` for a cross-cutting rule, the specific repo for a repo-specific gotcha.
And "decide on your own --- don't ask" above rules out the adjacent move too.
*Offering* to upstream a learning is not upstreaming it, and it spends a round trip to hear an answer already written here.
Open the PR.

- **Do:** commit a reusable learning to the repo that owns it, in the same stride you notice it.
- **Do:** pick the home by scope --- an `ai-config` shared fragment, `CLAUDE.md`, or `memories/` for a cross-repo rule;
  the specific repo's own docs for a repo-specific one.
- **Don't:** leave a reusable learning in session-local auto-memory as a substitute for committing it.
- **Don't:** offer to upstream it, or ask which repo --- decide and do it, surfacing the choice only when it is genuinely ambiguous or architecturally significant.

## PowerShell CLI Command Safety

- **Never pass backtick-containing content in PowerShell double-quoted strings**: PowerShell treats `` ` `` as its escape character — `` `b `` (Backspace, 0x08), `` `n ``, `` `t ``, `` `r ``, etc. — so Markdown code spans and other backtick-containing text will be silently corrupted. Use single-quoted strings (`'...'` / `@'...'@`) for inline content, or write to a file and pass `--body-file` for multi-line PR descriptions.
- **Use body files for GitHub PR descriptions**: Write multi-line PR descriptions to a temp file and pass `--body-file <file>` to `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit`, or `gh api -F body=@<file>` for raw API calls. This avoids terminal string-escaping corruption for any content with backticks or other shell-special characters.
- **The hazard is not PowerShell-specific, and not limited to PR descriptions**: bash and zsh double-quoted strings run backtick spans as command substitution, so `gh pr comment`, `gh issue comment`, and `gh api .../comments -f body="..."` / `.../replies -f body="..."` corrupt a backtick-carrying body exactly as `gh pr create --body "..."` does (a `` `ms.` `` code span runs `ms.` as a command and vanishes). Use `--body-file` / `-F body=@<file>` for comment and review-reply bodies too, in any shell. See `memories/git.md`'s "`gh pr comment` / `gh api ... -f body=` run backtick spans too" section.

## Strict Merge Control Policy

- **NEVER merge any Pull Request or Merge Request without explicit user permission.**
  Creating, opening, updating, or driving a PR to clean CI/review does NOT grant permission to merge it.
  Merging a PR is strictly forbidden unless the user explicitly grants session permission (e.g. via `/mwc` or `/maw`) or explicitly issues a merge instruction for that specific PR (e.g. `/merge-it` or "merge this PR").
