# pr-status

Report a PR’s review status honestly: based on the **most recent** review, with its findings actually parsed — never on an earlier cached “verdict.” A newer review may have landed since (from the `@claude` bot, a human, or a re-trigger), and it may carry findings the old one missed.

## When this fires

- “what’s the status of PR \#N”, “is \#N ready to merge”, “is the review clean”.
- Before you state, anywhere, that a PR is mergeable / clean / ready.

Commands below are annotated with their abstract operation token (e.g. `VIEW_PR`, `PR_CHECKS`) — resolve to your model’s tool via [`tool-mappings.md`](../../tool-mappings.md) instead of the `gh` command shown if this session doesn’t have `gh`.

## Verify the PR is still open first

Before checking CI or review, confirm the PR hasn’t merged or closed since you last looked:

``` bash
gh pr view <N> --json state,title --jq '"\(.state): \(.title)"'   # VIEW_PR
```

- `OPEN` → proceed with CI and review checks below.
- `MERGED` → stop; trigger `post-merge` instead of reporting CI details.
- `CLOSED` → stop; report the actual state to the user.

A PR can merge between a “status?” call and a follow-up “status?” in the same session. Running `gh pr checks` on a merged PR returns stale data and delays noticing the merge happened.

## CI green ≠ review clean

`gh pr checks <N>` (`PR_CHECKS`) going green is about **CI state**, not the review verdict. A PR can have all checks passing and still have unaddressed review findings. Always parse the latest **review body** for findings — don’t infer “clean” from green checks.

## Read the LATEST review, checked for currency

``` bash
gh pr view <N> --json comments,commits,headRefOid \
  --jq '{review: ([.comments[] | select(.author.login | startswith("claude"))] | last), lastCommitDate: (.commits[-1].committedDate), headRefOid: .headRefOid}'
```

**This call fetches more than `READ_PR_COMMENTS` maps to** – `tool-mappings.md` maps that token to a comments-only MCP call (`pull_request_read(method=get_comments)`), which returns neither `commits` nor `headRefOid`. In a remote/MCP session without `gh`, fetch those two fields with a separate call (e.g. `pull_request_read(method=get)` for `headRefOid`, plus the commits list) rather than assuming the token mapping covers this expanded query.

**If `.review.createdAt` is earlier than `.lastCommitDate`, the review predates the latest push** – treat it as stale, not current, regardless of what its body says (both are ISO 8601 UTC timestamps, so a plain string comparison works). This timing check alone is **not proof of currency**: `committedDate` is the commit’s local committer timestamp, not when GitHub received the push, so a commit authored earlier but pushed later can pass the timing check while still being newer than the review. When the review body names the commit it reviewed (the `@claude` bot commonly writes “commit `<sha>`”), cross-check that SHA’s prefix against `.headRefOid`. **Require a SHA match to call it `clean`** – when the review passes the timing check but names no SHA (or the mentioned SHA doesn’t match), report **`unverified`**, not clean, every time, not just when the gap “looks small” (there’s no reliable way to judge that from the timing check alone).

The reviewer’s bot login **varies by API and setup**:

- `gh pr view` reports it as `claude`
- the REST API (`gh api .../comments`) reports it as `claude[bot]`
- some setups post reviews as `github-actions[bot]`

`startswith("claude")` matches the @claude bot across both `gh pr view` and `gh api`. If your reviewer posts under a different login (e.g. `github-actions[bot]`), **broaden the filter** — otherwise the `--jq` returns `null` and you silently false-pass a PR with open findings. (Structured MCP GitHub tools like `mcp__github_ci__get_ci_status` are an alternative where the `gh` JSON parsing gets fragile.)

## Check for a genuine external verdict, not just self-review

The `@claude` comment above isn’t the whole picture. Per [`fully-clean.md`](../../shared/workflow/fully-clean.md), reporting a PR clean/ready requires a **genuine posted verdict at the current head from an external reviewer, whenever one is reachable** – a self-review (posted when `@claude` was skipped or stubbed) is a fallback, never a substitute, once an external reviewer becomes available again. Formal reviews (e.g. Copilot) don’t show up in the comments query above at all – they’re a separate review object.

**This is a status query – inspect an existing Copilot review, don’t request one.** Requesting a review is a mutation: it triggers a review job, consumes reviewer quota, and can collide with an active `ardi` loop driving the same PR. Use the read-only half of [`ardi`’s step 2](../../skills/ardi/SKILL.llms.md) – fetch the matched review’s body + inline comments at the current `commit_id` and require a zero-findings verdict – but skip the `POST /requested_reviewers` call. If no genuine Copilot verdict exists at the current head, report `no verdict at head` and offer to run `ardi` (which can request one); don’t request it yourself here. Green CI plus a clean self-review is not sufficient on its own if an external reviewer is reachable.

## Parse for findings before declaring clean

Read the full latest review body and scan for any “Findings”, “Issues”, “Remaining”, “Non-blocking”, “Minor”, “Could improve”, “Consider”, etc. section. The bar for reporting **clean**: “Looks good” / “no findings” / “approved” with **zero** follow-on bullets under any heading. A posted rebuttal the reviewer is still disputing is **open**, not clean — a rebuttal counts only once it convinced the reviewer (they dropped the item).

## Check for a blocking human CHANGES_REQUESTED

A bot’s clean verdict does **not** clear a human’s formal review state. A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review submitted via GitHub’s review UI is invisible to the comments query above – it’s a separate object, and often has an **empty** top-level body with the actual finding in an inline comment:

``` bash
gh pr view <N> --json reviews \
  --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login != null)] | group_by(.author.login) | map(sort_by(.submittedAt) | last) | .[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED") | "\(.author.login) \(.submittedAt)"'
```

**`--json reviews` returns the full review history, not one entry per reviewer** – an early `CHANGES_REQUESTED` from a reviewer who later approved would otherwise block forever. The `group_by` / `sort_by` / `last` chain reduces to each author’s *latest* review before filtering, matching what GitHub’s own UI shows as the current state (verified against this skill’s own PR: an author with an old `COMMENTED` round and no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` correctly produces no output).

If this returns anything, the PR is **blocking** regardless of what any bot says – only the human (or an explicit dismissal) resolves it. Report it as open and name the reviewer; don’t let a later “Ready for merge” bot comment paper over it.

A PR is only **fully clean / ready to merge** when **at least one** of the `@claude` comment or an external reviewer’s verdict (see *Check for a genuine external verdict* above) is clean at the current head – the canonical rule needs one genuine external verdict, not both; if a reachable external reviewer hasn’t posted a current-head verdict at all, that’s `no verdict at head`, not automatically a fail, but it means the `@claude` comment alone has to carry the “clean” claim *and* no human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review is outstanding *and* all CI workflows are green *and* every inline review thread is resolved (the only open conversation being the final all-clear and your reply to it — see *Check thread-resolution state* below). Do **not** report “ready to merge with one minor nit noted” / “harmless as-is” / “can address if you want” — that hedging just pushes triage back to the user. If there are open items, report them as open (and offer to run `ardi` to clear them).

## Check thread-resolution state

A clean review *body* isn’t the whole bar — unresolved inline threads count as open too. Count the unresolved ones via GraphQL:

``` bash
gh api graphql -f query='query {
  repository(owner:"<owner>", name:"<repo>") {
    pullRequest(number:<N>) {
      reviewThreads(first:100) {
        totalCount
        nodes { isResolved }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads as $rt |
  ($rt.nodes | map(select(.isResolved | not)) | length) as $open |
  if $rt.totalCount > ($rt.nodes | length)
  then "\($open)+ open (totalCount \($rt.totalCount); cap reached — may undercount)"
  else "\($open)"
  end'
```

Interpret the output as:

- `0` — all threads resolved; clean on this dimension.
- A plain non-zero number (e.g. `3`) — that many threads are unresolved.
- A `+`-suffixed string (e.g. `0+ open (totalCount 150; cap reached — may undercount)`) — the 100-thread cap was hit. **Cannot confirm clean**, even if the visible count is 0; treat as unresolved until the cap is lifted or the PR is confirmed clean another way.

(The resolve mutation lives in the `ard` skill, step 4b.)

## Output

State, plainly: the latest review’s verdict, who/what posted it, and the list of any open findings (or “none”). If you read `null`, say the filter didn’t match a reviewer login — don’t report it as clean.
