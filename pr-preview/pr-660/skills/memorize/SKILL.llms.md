# Memorize

Persist a single fact or preference so it survives across sessions, machines, and agents. **`remember` / `/remember` and `always` / `/always` are synonyms for this skill** — same behavior; the wording the user happens to use doesn’t change anything.

Unlike `ums` (which reviews the whole session and may also update skill definitions), this stores exactly what the user says — no scanning, no skill updates. Memory files — and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — are symlinked into the ai-config repo, so memorize **commits and pushes** the one change; otherwise the note is lost when the session ends (ephemeral cloud containers are reclaimed) and never syncs elsewhere.

## When this fires

- “memorize …”, “remember that …”, “/remember …”, “note that …”, “add to memories: …”
- A standing directive phrased as a preference: “always …”, “never …”, “I prefer …”, “from now on …”

## First: is it actually a memory?

If the request is an **automated every-time action** (“after each commit run X”, “whenever I edit Y do Z”), memory can’t execute it — that needs a **hook** in `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` (use the `update-config` skill). Say so and route it there; don’t store a note that will never fire.

Unsure whether a request is really a memory versus a skill, subagent, hook, or `gha` capability? `config-ai` (`ca`/`cai`) is the broader router across all of those forms — this skill is what it hands off to once memory is the answer.

## Procedure

1.  **Parse** the fact/preference from the user’s message.

2.  **Choose scope by relevance**:

    - **Project-specific, a repo we own** — a fact, convention, or gotcha tied to ONE specific repo we own (“renders with renv via `R_LIBS_USER`”) → commit it to **that project’s own repo** via a PR (its `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or whatever agent-doc infrastructure it already has), so the whole team and every `@claude` session there can see it. (NOT `memories/repo/` inside ai-config; that directory is removed.) If the repo has no agent-doc infrastructure yet, write to its local Claude project memory instead — `~/.claude/projects/<project-path>/memory/<file>.md` — as **short-lived staging only, not a durable destination**, and tell the user a PR adding agent-doc infrastructure to that repo (plus migrating the staged memory there) is still needed. The project path is the repo’s directory path with `/` replaced by `-` — e.g. `/Users/you/Documents/GitHub/rme` → `-Users-you-Documents-GitHub-rme`. Update `MEMORY.md` in that directory as an index entry when you used this local-staging fallback — not when the fact was committed directly to the owned repo’s own agent docs, which needs no local copy.
    - **Project-specific, an external repo we don’t own** — never open a direct PR autonomously. Route it through [`upstream-issues`](../../shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md): check the repo’s contribution policy first (some ban autonomous AI PRs/issues outright), then draft and get **explicit user approval** before posting anything. Until approved, stage the fact in that repo’s local Claude project memory as short-lived, not-yet-durable staging.
    - **General standing rule** — an always-apply working preference across ALL repos (“always link PRs in tables”, “use Pacific time”) → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (it’s loaded every session)
    - **General reference fact** — a cross-project fact that only matters when relevant (“gh opens a pager — pipe to cat”) → a topical file in `/memories/` (e.g. `tools.md`, `debugging.md`). When you add a *new* file here (not just a bullet to an existing one), register it in `memories/MEMORY.md` as an index entry.
    - **Conversation-only** → `/memories/session/`
    - When ambiguous between project and general, judge by relevance; default to general.

3.  **Choose file**: read the target’s current contents first. Append to an existing section/file if one fits; otherwise create a descriptively named file — and when you create a *new* file under `/memories/`, add a row for it to `memories/MEMORY.md` (the index). Don’t duplicate — if it’s already recorded, update in place rather than stacking a second copy, and say so. Delete a memory that turns out wrong instead of leaving a contradiction.

4.  **Write** a concise bullet (one line preferred), matching the file’s voice; include the *why* if it isn’t obvious. Don’t record what the repo already documents (code structure, git history) — capture only the non-obvious.

5.  **Commit & push** the change so it persists. What that means depends on where step 2 wrote it:

    - **Project’s own repo, owned** — commit, push a branch, and open a PR there, same as any other change to that repo.
    - **Project’s own repo, external (not owned)** — never push/open a PR directly; follow `upstream-issues` (policy check, draft, explicit user approval) instead.
    - **`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` staging** (the project repo has no agent-doc infrastructure yet, or is external and not yet approved) — no git commit; it persists locally only. Tell the user this is temporary staging and what’s still needed (agent-doc infra added via a PR, or upstream approval).
    - **`/memories/session/`** — skip; conversation-only notes shouldn’t enter the shared repo.
    - **Everything else — including `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` writes — gets committed** to ai-config. This assumes `bootstrap.sh` has symlinked `memories/` and `CLAUDE.md` into the ai-config repo (the expected setup) and that ai-config is your working repo. When you’re **working primarily in another repo** and want to push a general memory to ai-config from there, use `push-memory` instead — it delivers on a branch + PR and never touches the repo you’re in. Resolve the repo from the `memories/` symlink and stage the file by its path *within* the repo (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` follows the symlink to the repo root, robust across one or many hops — unlike single-hop `readlink`):

    ``` bash
    [ -L ~/.claude/memories ] || { echo "~/.claude/memories isn't a symlink — run bootstrap.sh first"; exit 1; }
    repo="$(git -C ~/.claude/memories rev-parse --show-toplevel)"   # ai-config repo root
    rel="CLAUDE.md"   # or memories/<file>.md  (NOT memories/repo/ — that's gone)
    git -C "$repo" add "$rel" \
      && git -C "$repo" commit -m "memorize: <one-line summary>" \
      && git -C "$repo" push origin HEAD   # current branch; not HEAD:main — that would push a feature branch's commits onto main
    ```

    The push targets the ai-config repo’s **current branch**, so run memorize from a checkout on `main` (the normal case) — that’s where shared memory belongs. In an ephemeral cloud session the push is mandatory: an unpushed commit dies with the container.

    **Worktree session / occupied main checkout.** `~/.claude/memories` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are symlinked to the **main** checkout, so `git -C ~/.claude/memories rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to the main checkout — *not* your worktree. If that checkout is on a non-`main` branch (e.g. another session is working there, possibly with uncommitted edits), committing through the symlink lands your memory on the wrong branch and can tangle with that session’s work. In that case don’t commit through the symlink: edit the memory file at its path inside **your** worktree, commit on your worktree branch, and land it via branch + PR + merge. It only reaches the live symlinked memory once it merges to `main` and the main checkout updates. (See the worktree-isolation and no-`cd`-in-worktree bullets in `memories/preferences.md`, and the `session-lock` skill.)

6.  **Confirm**: one sentence — what was stored, where, and that it was pushed.

## Don’t

- Don’t run a full session review or touch skill files (that’s `ums`).
- Don’t commit unrelated changes — stage only the file you wrote.
- Don’t push conversation-only (`/memories/session/`) notes to the shared repo.
- Don’t store secrets, tokens, or passwords.
- Don’t over-elaborate — one bullet per fact.
