"""Automated verification tool for ARDI / fully-clean status.

Verifies that:
1. All GitHub Actions check runs for the PR's HEAD commit SHA are completed and passing.
2. An automated review comment evaluating the exact HEAD commit SHA has been posted.
3. All review comments evaluating the HEAD commit SHA contain zero findings, and no active CHANGES_REQUESTED or REJECTED state exists on the PR.
4. The LATEST verdict-bearing statement across the whole review history is clean.

Criterion 4 is deliberately scoped wider than criteria 2 and 3, which look only
at items evaluating the current HEAD SHA. An explicit "Needs more work" posted
against an EARLIER commit falls outside them entirely, and a later comment that
states no verdict raises no finding either -- so the PR reads clean while its
last actual verdict was "Needs more work". Absence of a verdict is not a
clearing: only a later CLEAN verdict supersedes an earlier not-clean one.
See shared/workflow/fully-clean.md and Morrison-Lab/ai-config#1275.

Exit codes:
0: Fully clean (safe to end ARDI loop)
1: Not clean (in-progress checks, failing checks, missing review, findings present,
   or a standing not-clean verdict that nothing later superseded)
