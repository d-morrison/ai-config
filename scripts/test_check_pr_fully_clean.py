"""Regression and unit tests for scripts/check-pr-fully-clean.py.

Tests:
1. CI check run status filtering (completed with success/neutral/skipped vs in_progress/failure).
2. Review comment parsing (clean verdict vs finding pattern matching).
3. Formal GitHub review parsing with empty top-level comments (state: CHANGES_REQUESTED vs APPROVED/COMMENTED).
4. Review prose containing modifier variations like "No major changes requested".
5. Robust handling of None author objects in review payloads.
