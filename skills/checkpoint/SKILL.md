# checkpoint — deliberate mid-task snapshot

Bank a durable snapshot of where a long task stands **without stopping the
session** — the user keeps working, or the agent keeps going, right after
writing it. This is the lightweight, frequent counterpart to
[`handoff`](../handoff/SKILL.md): `handoff` is a heavier session-end/pause
snapshot (branch state, unpushed commits, running jobs, a PR note);
`checkpoint` is a quick "here's what's been decided and done so far,"
written mid-task so a crash, a context compaction, or a session restart
doesn't lose the plan.

## When this fires

- "checkpoint", "save a checkpoint", "snapshot where we are", "note our
  progress"
- Proactively, without being asked, at natural stop-points inside a long task:
  - right before a risky or hard-to-reverse step (a force-push, a destructive
    migration, a large refactor) — so the pre-step state is recoverable
  - immediately after finishing a distinct phase of a multi-phase task (e.g.
    "design agreed, starting implementation")
  - before a long-running operation whose completion you might not be present
    for (kicking off a background build, handing work to a subagent, before a
    `ScheduleWakeup`)

Skip it for short tasks with no distinct phases — there's nothing worth
snapshotting yet.

## Distinction from `compress-session` and `handoff`

Three different triggers, three different jobs — don't conflate them:

| Skill | Trigger | Session continues? | What it captures |
|-------|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| `checkpoint` | Deliberate, mid-task | Yes | Plan state, decisions, next actions |
| `compress-session` | Approaching auto-compaction | Yes (context shrinks) | A structured distillation of the whole conversation so far |
| `handoff` | Ending/pausing the session | No | Full resumption state: branch, unpushed commits, running jobs, PR note |

A `checkpoint` note is a strict subset of what `handoff` captures — it skips
the branch/job/PR-note mechanics because the session isn't ending. If you're
about to genuinely stop, run `handoff` instead (or in addition, if the
checkpoint predates the stop by a while and the state has moved on).

## Procedure

### 1. Write the checkpoint note

Capture, concretely, in a short note (not a session history — this is a
snapshot, not a transcript):

- **What's been decided** — the plan or approach agreed on so far, and any
  option explicitly ruled out (so it isn't re-litigated later).
- **What's done** — concrete progress: files touched (`path:line` pointers,
  not just names), commits made, PRs/issues opened.
- **What's next** — the specific next action, not a vague "continue
  implementing."
- **Anything fragile** — a value that might go stale (a fetched API result, a
  timestamp), an assumption worth re-verifying if much time has passed before
  resuming.

Save it as a project memory, the same convention `handoff` uses:
`~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/memory/checkpoint-<slug>.md`, frontmatter
`type: project`. Reuse (update in place) an existing checkpoint file for the
same task rather than piling up one file per checkpoint — a checkpoint
supersedes the last one for the same task, it doesn't append to a log.

### 2. Confirm briefly

One or two lines: what was checkpointed, and where. This isn't a session
wrap-up, so don't produce a long report — the point is that it happened, not
a recap of it.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`handoff`** — the heavier session-end/pause counterpart; see the
  distinction table above.
- **`compress-session`** — the pre-auto-compaction counterpart; see the
  distinction table above. The two can coincide (a checkpoint written just
  before compaction hits also happens to serve as compression fodder), but
  they're triggered independently.
- **`wrap-up`** — closes out the *whole* session (every open PR/issue/branch)
  plus a UMS pass; `checkpoint` is scoped to the current task's plan state,
  not the whole session's state.
- **`memorize`** — general-purpose fact persistence; `checkpoint` is the
  specialized "resumable task state" case, structured like `handoff`'s note
  rather than a single durable fact.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Writing a checkpoint for every trivial step — reserve it for genuine
  phase boundaries or risky steps, or it becomes noise no one reads back.
- ❌ Treating a checkpoint as a full `handoff` — it doesn't need branch/job/PR
  state; if you need that too, run `handoff`.
- ❌ Appending a new file per checkpoint instead of updating the task's one
  checkpoint file in place.
