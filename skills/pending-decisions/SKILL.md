  Sweep a repo's (or every in-scope repo's) open issues and PRs for ones

  activity — then ask about each one, one at a time, most pressing first.
  The issue-tracker-scoped analog of `prompt-me`/`prompt-me-all`, which only
  see the current conversation. Use when asked to 'pending decisions', 'pd',
  'what decisions are you waiting on', 'any decisions needed from me', 'check
  for pending decisions', 'sweep issues for decisions', 'is anything stalled
  on my input', or '/pending-decisions [owner/repo|all]'.

# pending-decisions — surface issues/PRs waiting on a decision from you (pd)

`prompt-me` / `prompt-me-all` sweep the **current conversation** for questions
left unanswered. They can't see a question a *prior* session left stalled on
an issue or PR — that stub sits in the tracker until someone happens to reopen
it. This skill sweeps the **tracker itself**: it finds issues/PRs genuinely
waiting on the user's decision and triggers the question-asking, one item at a
time.

## When this fires

- Explicit invocation: `/pending-decisions`, `/pd`, "pending decisions", "pd".
- "what decisions are you waiting on", "any decisions needed from me", "check
  for pending decisions", "is anything stalled on my input", "sweep issues for
  decisions".
- With a scope argument: `pd all` (every repo in this session's GitHub
  scope), `pd owner/repo` (one specific repo).

## Step 1 — Decide scope

- No argument → the **current repo** only.
- `all` / "every repo" / "sweep everything" → every repo in this session's
  GitHub scope (the "Repository Scope" list, plus any repo added via
  `add_repo` this session).
- `owner/repo` → that repo specifically.

State the scope you're using before searching, so a wrong guess is cheap to
correct.

## Step 2 — Find candidates

For each repo in scope, search for open issues/PRs against these signals,
most reliable first. An item can hit more than one signal; that's fine, dedupe
in Step 3.

1. **Explicit review-request escalation** — `search_issues` with
   `repo:<owner>/<repo> is:open review-requested:d-morrison`. This is exactly
   the deadlock-escalation mechanism `ardi`/`fully-clean`/
   `address-every-comment` already use ("request a human reviewer... surface
   the open item to me") — a hit here is unambiguous: something is genuinely
   stalled on the user.
2. **A decision-style label**, if the repo defines one — `search_issues` with
   `repo:<owner>/<repo> is:open label:question` (GitHub's common default
   label) or whatever the repo's own convention names.
3. **An unresolved bot-posed question in recent activity** — the noisiest
   signal, so bound it: pull the ~30 most recently updated open issues/PRs
   (`search_issues ... sort:updated`), and for each, read the latest comment
   (`pull_request_read` `get_comments` / `issue_read` `get_comments`, plus
   `get_review_comments` for inline threads on PRs). Count it as a candidate
   only when **all** of:
   - the latest comment is bot/agent-authored, not human — a human's own
     question is a normal review finding to address, not something the user
     is waiting on;
   - it reads as a question or decision request directed at the user — a ❓
     **QUESTION**/🛑 **BLOCKER** marker, "your call", "which of these", "need
     your input", explicit deadlock/escalation language, or a plain question
     ending in `?`;
   - no reply from the repo owner has landed since.

   This is a judgment call, not a regex — when it's unclear whether a comment
   is still live or was already resolved by later activity, read the
   surrounding thread rather than guessing either way. If more open items
   exist beyond the ~30-item window, say so ("N more open issues not scanned
   for this signal") instead of silently under-covering.

## Step 3 — Dedupe and rank

Collect every candidate across repos and signals into one list, dedupe by
issue/PR number, and rank most-pressing first:

1. **Blocking** first — a `review-requested` escalation (Signal 1) is always
   blocking; something is already stalled.
2. Within a tier, **more recently updated** beats older.

(Same ordering `prompt-me`/`prompt-me-all` use for conversation-scoped
questions — reused here rather than re-derived.)

## Step 4 — Present one at a time

Apply the "Present decisions one at a time" rule
(proposed in [ai-config#584](https://github.com/d-morrison/ai-config/pull/584) —
once merged, follow that `CLAUDE.md` section directly; until then, apply the
same logic inline): pose only the single most pressing candidate — quote or
paraphrase the actual question, link the issue/PR, state how many more are
queued — then wait for the answer before moving to the next. Fold each answer
into the framing of the next question, and drop any later candidate the
answer already mooted.

## Step 5 — Close the loop

Once the user answers a candidate:

1. **Post the decision back** as a comment on that issue/PR (paraphrased, per
   `CLAUDE.md`'s "Post in-chat feedback to the PR"), so the record is visible
   to future sessions and bots — not just this transcript.
2. **Resume the work now** if this session can act on it immediately (the
   repo is in scope and nothing else blocks it) — don't just record the
   answer and stop when you could unblock the work in the same turn.
3. If it can't be acted on immediately (the repo is out of this session's
   scope, or the work belongs to a different in-flight session), say so
   plainly — the comment is still posted, so the decision isn't lost.

## Step 6 — Nothing found

If the sweep turns up nothing, say so plainly ("no pending decisions found
across `<repos>`") rather than manufacturing a candidate to fill the report.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`prompt-me` / `prompt-me-all`** — the conversation-scoped analog; this
  skill is scoped to the issue/PR tracker instead, so it survives across
  sessions and finds what a transcript-only sweep can't see.
- **`CLAUDE.md`'s "Present decisions one at a time"** ([#584](https://github.com/d-morrison/ai-config/pull/584)) —
  the presentation mechanic Step 4 reuses rather than redefining.
- **`ardi` / `fully-clean` / `address-every-comment`** — the mechanisms that
  produce most Signal-1 candidates (a deadlock escalated to a human
  reviewer via `request-pr-review`).
- **`post-merge`** — once a candidate's issue/PR merges or closes, it drops
  out of the next sweep on its own; nothing extra to clean up here.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Surfacing a Signal-3 candidate without confirming no human reply landed
  since the bot's question — stale noise dragged back into view.
- ❌ Batching several candidates into one message instead of one at a time —
  defeats the point (see `CLAUDE.md`'s "Present decisions one at a time").
- ❌ Treating a human reviewer's own question (posed *to* the bot, not the
  other way around) as a pending decision — that's a normal review finding to
  address/rebut/defer, not something the user is waiting on.
- ❌ Silently dropping a real candidate because it didn't match Signal 3's
  literal cues — it's a judgment call; read the thread when unsure.
- ❌ Recording the answer as a comment but not resuming blocked work this
  session could otherwise act on immediately.
