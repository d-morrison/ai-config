# giardia (alias for `gia`)

This is a mnemonic alias for the **gia** (Grab Issues + iterate-All) skill,
which clears the repo's entire work queue end to end: drive every open PR/MR to
a clean review verdict with green CI, and open a PR for every open issue that
lacks one (each new PR is itself driven to clean).
Read and follow the canonical skill:

→ **[gia](../gia/SKILL.md)**

> The name is apt, not just a pun: **giardia** splits into **`gi` + `ardia`**,
> the two halves `gia` composes — grabbing issues
> ([`gii`](../gii/SKILL.md), the whole backlog) and
> [`ardia`](../ardia/SKILL.md) (ARD-iterate-all). `gia` runs them PRs-first
> (`ardia`, then `gii`), the reverse of the order the letters fall in — the
> mnemonic is for the pairing, not the sequence.
