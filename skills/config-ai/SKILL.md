# config-ai — route AI-capability requests to the right implementation (ca, cai)

This skill doesn't build anything itself. It figures out *what kind* of thing
a capability request needs, then hands off to the skill (or repo convention)
that actually builds it — with a repo-access-aware fallback so a request
never gets silently dropped just because the current session can't push to
`ai-config` or `gha`.

## When this fires

- "config-ai", "ca", "cai"
- "extend AI capabilities", "add an AI capability for X", "teach Claude to
  X", "give Claude the ability to X", "make Claude able to X", "wire this up
  so Claude always/automatically does X"
- A request names a desired behavior without naming a mechanism — that's the
  tell that this skill, not a specific builder skill, is the right entry
  point.

## Step 0 — Restate the capability, not the mechanism

State in one sentence what the requester wants Claude (or Codex, or the
`@claude` bot, or a `gha` consumer's CI) to be able to do. Don't presuppose
the implementation yet — "add a hook that reminds me to X" is already half an
answer the requester may not have meant.

Then check it's actually reusable, not a one-off. A single favor for right
now doesn't need infrastructure — just do it. `config-ai` is for capability
that should persist beyond this conversation.

## Step 1 — Pick the implementation form

Work down this table; stop at the first row that fits. Each row hands off to
the skill or convention that owns that mechanism — this skill does not
duplicate their build steps.

| The capability is... | Form | Home | Hand off to |
|---|---|---|---|
| A repeatable, multi-step procedure a user (or the `@claude` bot) invokes on demand | Skill | `ai-config` `skills/<name>/` | `skill-builder` |
| A persistent, read-only fan-out worker persona a heavy skill spawns | Subagent | `ai-config` `.claude/agents/<name>.md` | `agent-builder` |
| A standing fact, preference, or behavioral rule Claude should just know | Memory / `CLAUDE.md` section | `ai-config` `memories/`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a `shared/<category>/<name>.md` fragment | `memorize` (working repo is `ai-config`) or `push-memory` (working repo is something else) |
| An automated action the harness itself must trigger on an event Claude doesn't control the timing of (session start, before/after a tool call, on stop) | Hook | `~/.claude/settings.json` (synced from `ai-config`) | the harness's built-in `update-config` skill (not part of this repo's `skills/` tree) |
| Reusable text shared verbatim across multiple skills or docs — not itself a rule | Shared prompt fragment | `ai-config` `shared/<category>/<name>.md`, referenced with `@shared/...` | no builder skill owns this; follow the existing `shared/` layout (`coding/`, `vendored/`, `workflow/`, `writing/`) and wire the `@shared/...` reference into `CLAUDE.md` and/or the skill(s) that need it |
| A capability *other repos'* CI should be able to call — a composite action a workflow step runs, or a `workflow_call` reusable workflow consumers pin to `@v1` | GitHub Action | `gha` repo root composite + `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` wrapper + `examples/<name>.yml` | follow `gha`'s own `CLAUDE.md` "Layout" section: composite (+ helper script if R/Python) → wrapper → example stub → `README.md`/`website/` doc sync (see its "new `workflow_call` input" doc-sync-site list) |
| A change to how the `@claude` bot itself behaves when invoked on a PR/issue — not what it can do for consumers, how *it* runs | Bot CI workflow | `gha` `.github/workflows/claude.yml` or `claude-code-review.yml` | `claude-agent-workflow` (agent/action workflow) or `claude-review-workflow` (PR review workflow) |

If more than one row plausibly fits (common: "always check X before Y" could
be a memory *or* a hook), prefer the **least mechanism**: memory over hook (a
hook needs harness config that can silently stop firing if `settings.json`
drifts; a memory just needs Claude to read `CLAUDE.md`), a skill over a
subagent (a subagent only earns its keep when reused across call sites or the
tool boundary is load-bearing — see `agent-builder`'s step 2), and a shared
fragment over a new skill when the content already lives inside another
skill's procedure and a new skill would just duplicate it.

## Step 2 — Reuse-check before building anything

Every mechanism above already has its own extend-first check; run it rather
than scaffolding cold:

- Skill / subagent → `skill-builder` step 0 / `agent-builder` step 0 (search
  `skills/`, scan every branch and worktree, check open PRs).
- Memory → grep `memories/*.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for the same fact before
  adding a new bullet.
- Shared fragment → grep `shared/**/*.md` for the same content before writing
  a new file.
- `gha` capability → `ls` the repo root for an existing composite that's
  adjacent, and check `examples/` for a stub that already covers it.
- Bot workflow → read the existing `claude.yml` / `claude-code-review.yml`
  end to end first; both skills document the load-bearing patterns not to
  break.

## Step 3 — Check push access to the target repo, then ship

The target repo is `ai-config` for the first five rows above, `gha` for the
last two.

1. **Can this session push to the target repo?** Check the session's GitHub
   scope (the "Repository Scope" list in a remote/web session's system
   prompt, or a `git remote -v` / `gh repo view <owner>/<repo>` probe
   locally), and whether a push would actually be accepted — a scoped
   session may be able to push only its own harness-assigned branch (see
   `CLAUDE.md`'s "Use the existing PR branch" 403 exception).
   - **Yes** → proceed normally: branch off `main` in the target repo, build
     via the skill/convention chosen in Step 1, open a PR, request review,
     `ardi` to clean. The common case; nothing extra needed from this skill.
2. **No push access, but the session can still read the target repo and open
   issues on it** (GitHub MCP scope or `gh`/API access, just not write
   access to code) → don't lose the request. File one fully-specified issue
   on the target repo describing: the capability in one sentence, the
   implementation form chosen in Step 1 and why, the target file(s)/path(s),
   and enough detail that a future `gi`/`grab-issue` session — which does
   have push access — can build it unattended. Don't claim it (`claim-pr`'s
   "paws off" comment is for a session about to implement); leave it open
   for whoever picks it up.
3. **No access to the target repo at all** (not in the session's GitHub
   scope, no network path, issue creation itself fails) → file the issue in
   the **current** repo instead — whatever repo the session is actually
   working in. Write it standalone, since a future reader won't have this
   conversation's context: state plainly that it's really a request for
   `ai-config`/`gha` and needs to move there. Ask the user to use GitHub's
   **Transfer issue** feature once a session with access is available. This
   mirrors `shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md`'s own-repo fallback (its step
   3), applied here because `ai-config`/`gha` are just as "upstream" of a
   differently-scoped session as any external dependency is.

Never silently drop a capability request because the current session happens
to lack push access to the target repo — one of these three always applies.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`skill-builder`**, **`agent-builder`** — the construction steps for the
  first two rows of the decision table; this skill is the router that
  decides *which* of them (or a different mechanism entirely) applies, then
  gets out of the way.
- **`spot-skill-opportunities`** — proactively notices, mid-task, when a
  *skill or agent* specifically is warranted; narrower than this skill (only
  those two forms) and unprompted (it doesn't wait for the user to name a
  capability). `config-ai` is the explicit, user-invoked entry point across
  the *full* mechanism set — memory, hooks, shared fragments, and `gha`
  Actions/bot-workflow tuning included, not just skills/agents.
- **`memorize`** / **`push-memory`** / **`ums`** — own the memory/preference
  row; `push-memory` is specifically the delivery mechanism when the working
  repo isn't `ai-config` but the session still has API/branch access to it —
  narrower than this skill's Step 3, which also covers the case where even
  that access is missing.
- **`claude-agent-workflow`**, **`claude-review-workflow`** — own the
  bot-CI-tuning row; both already document the load-bearing patterns in
  `claude.yml`/`claude-code-review.yml` this skill doesn't repeat.
- **`upstream-issues`** (`shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md`) — the general
  escalation pattern (PR → issue on target → issue on own repo, ask for
  transfer) this skill's Step 3 specializes for the `ai-config`/`gha` case,
  where the "external" repos are the user's own but may still be out of the
  current session's scope.
- **`issue-first`** (`shared/workflow/issue-first.md`) / **`st`** — the
  issue-before-PR discipline Step 3's normal push-access path still follows
  once a form is chosen.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Picking a form and building it without running Step 2's reuse/extend
  check — `skill-builder`/`agent-builder`/etc. already require it; this skill
  doesn't get an exemption.
- ❌ Reaching for a hook when a `CLAUDE.md` memory would do — a hook adds
  harness-config surface area a memory doesn't need.
- ❌ Building a `gha` capability as an `ai-config` skill (or vice versa)
  because it's the repo the session happens to be in — the mechanism's home
  is fixed by what it serves (Claude/Codex behavior vs. other repos' CI), not
  by convenience.
- ❌ Silently dropping a request when the session lacks push access instead
  of running Step 3's fallback ladder.
- ❌ Filing the fallback issue in the current repo without explicitly asking
  for a GitHub "Transfer issue" — an untransferred issue is a request nobody
  will ever see again.
- ❌ Duplicating a builder skill's procedure inline instead of handing off to
  it.
