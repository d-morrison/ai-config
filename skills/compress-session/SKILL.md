# compress-session — deliberate pre-compaction distillation

Claude Code auto-compacts long conversations on its own once the context
window fills up (see [What survives
compaction](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/context-window.md#what-survives-compaction)).
The automatic pass guesses what to keep. This skill runs **before** that
happens so a higher-fidelity, structured distillation — one the agent
actually controls — is what carries forward, using two mechanisms Claude
Code already provides rather than any custom hook:

1. **Auto memory (`MEMORY.md`)** is re-injected from disk automatically after
   any compaction — no hook needed. Writing the distillation there is enough
   to survive compaction.
2. **A focused manual `/compact`** — running `/compact focus on <what
   matters>` before the automatic pass kicks in lets the summary keep what
   you choose, instead of what the automatic pass guesses.

## When this fires

- "compress the session", "distill context before compacting", "summarize
  before compaction"
- Proactively, without being asked, when the conversation is visibly long and
  compaction looks imminent (many tool calls, a long back-and-forth, an
  explicit context-limit warning from the harness)

## What this is not

- Not `checkpoint` — that's a deliberate mid-task snapshot triggered by task
  *phase*, written to its own topic file under the same memory directory
  (not `MEMORY.md` itself, since it doesn't need to survive compaction
  automatically the way this skill's distillation does). See `checkpoint`'s
  distinction table.
- Not `handoff` — that's for ending/pausing the session; this skill doesn't
  end anything, it just makes sure the parts worth keeping survive the
  *next* compaction, automatic or manual.
- Not a way to keep the raw conversation — compaction still replaces message
  history with a summary regardless. This skill only makes sure a
  deliberately-chosen distillation, not just the automatic pass's guess, is
  what that summary (or `MEMORY.md`) preserves.

## Procedure

### 1. Write the distillation into `MEMORY.md`

`MEMORY.md` lives at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md` (the
same auto-memory directory `handoff`/`checkpoint`/`memorize` use) and its
first 200 lines or 25KB, whichever is smaller, are re-injected into context
automatically after every compaction — this is the load-bearing property
this skill relies on. Keep the entry itself short and move real detail into
a separate topic file in the same directory (referenced from `MEMORY.md`),
since only `MEMORY.md` itself is guaranteed to reload after compaction —
topic files reload only when Claude reads them again.

Capture, concisely:

- **The task and its current state** — what's being done, what's done, what's
  left.
- **Decisions made and why** — especially anything the automatic pass might
  compress away as "detail" but that later steps depend on (a chosen
  approach, a ruled-out alternative and why).
- **Concrete facts gathered this session** — file:line pointers, PR/issue
  numbers, verified claims (e.g. from a research pass) that would be
  expensive to re-derive.
- **Next action** — the specific next step.

Update the existing `MEMORY.md` entry for this task in place rather than
appending a new one each time — `MEMORY.md` has a strict size budget for
what auto-reloads, so a growing pile of stale entries pushes the current,
relevant one past the 200-line/25KB cutoff.

### 2. Trigger a focused compact yourself, rather than waiting

Once the distillation is written, you can additionally run `/compact focus
on <what to keep>` right away instead of waiting for the automatic pass —
per the docs, "the summary keeps what you choose instead of what the
automatic pass guesses is important." This is optional (step 1 alone
already protects the distillation), but worth doing when you know
compaction is imminent and want the *conversation summary itself* — not
just `MEMORY.md` — to reflect a deliberate choice.

### 3. Confirm briefly

State that the distillation was written to `MEMORY.md` (and whether a
focused `/compact` was also triggered). Don't produce a long report — this
is meant to be a quick, low-ceremony action.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`checkpoint`** — the deliberate, phase-triggered sibling that writes to
  its own topic file rather than `MEMORY.md` itself, because it doesn't need
  the auto-reload-after-compaction property. See its distinction table for
  the trigger/scope difference.
- **`handoff`** — the session-end/pause counterpart; run that instead when
  the session is actually stopping, not just compacting.
- **`memorize`** — general-purpose fact persistence via the same auto-memory
  mechanism; this skill is the specialized "protect the highest-value facts
  against the next compaction" case, with the added `/compact focus`
  trigger.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Assuming a custom `PreCompact`/`SessionStart` hook is needed to survive
  compaction — auto memory already re-injects `MEMORY.md` automatically;
  don't add hook complexity for something the harness already does.
- ❌ Writing the distillation to a topic file only, with nothing in
  `MEMORY.md` itself — topic files don't auto-reload after compaction, only
  `MEMORY.md`'s first 200 lines/25KB do.
- ❌ Appending a new `MEMORY.md` entry per compaction instead of updating the
  task's existing entry in place — bloats `MEMORY.md` past its auto-load
  budget and pushes the current entry out.
