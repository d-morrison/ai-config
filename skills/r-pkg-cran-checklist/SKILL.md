# r-pkg-cran-checklist

Walks through the standard items CRAN expects before accepting a package
submission or update. This skill doesn't duplicate the mechanics of a full
check or a NEWS entry — it points at `r-pkg-check` and `r-pkg-news` for
those sub-steps and covers everything else.

**Why this exists:** nothing in the repo tracked the CRAN-specific items
beyond a plain package check — version bump discipline, `cran-comments.md`,
reverse-dependency checks, and the win-builder/rhub cross-platform checks
CRAN's own submission form expects an answer about.

## Procedure

Work through each item; don't submit until every one is checked.

1. **Clean `R CMD check --as-cran`.** Run
   [`r-pkg-check`](../r-pkg-check/SKILL.md) with the `--as-cran` flag
   (`Rscript -e 'devtools::check(args = "--as-cran")'`) and resolve every
   NOTE, WARNING, and ERROR it reports — CRAN's own submission processing
   runs this exact check and rejects anything short of clean or
   fully-explained.

2. **Version bump.** Confirm `DESCRIPTION`'s `Version:` field increased
   from the last version CRAN has (check
   `https://cran.r-project.org/package=<pkg>` or
   `available.packages()["<pkg>", "Version"]`), following semantic
   versioning appropriate to the change (patch for a fix, minor for a new
   feature, major for a breaking change).

3. **NEWS.md entry.** Confirm an entry exists for the version being
   submitted, under a heading matching that version. Use
   [`r-pkg-news`](../r-pkg-news/SKILL.md) to draft one if it's missing.

4. **`cran-comments.md`.** Confirm the package root has a
   `cran-comments.md` (CRAN's expected file for submission notes) stating:
   - The R versions and platforms checked (typically via `devtools::check()`
     locally, `devtools::check_win_devel()`/`check_win_release()` for
     win-builder, and `rhub::rhub_check()` for cross-platform checks).
   - Any remaining NOTEs and why they're expected/harmless (e.g. "This is a
     new submission" or a known false-positive spelling flag).
   - A `## Downstream dependencies` section, even if just "There are
     currently no downstream dependencies for this package" — required for
     every submission, not just ones with revdeps.

5. **win-builder and r-hub checks.** Run (or confirm recently run):

   ```r
   devtools::check_win_devel()
   devtools::check_win_release()
   rhub::rhub_check()
   ```

   These catch platform-specific failures (Windows path handling, Solaris/
   macOS compiler differences) that a local check on one platform can't.
   Wait for the emailed/posted results before submitting if they were just
   triggered — they run asynchronously.

6. **Reverse-dependency checks.** If the package has downstream dependents
   (check `https://cran.r-project.org/package=<pkg>` "Reverse dependencies"
   or run `tools::package_dependencies(<pkg>, reverse = TRUE)`), run their
   checks against this version (`revdepcheck::revdep_check()`) and report
   any new failures to their maintainers before submitting, per CRAN policy.
   Skip this step only if there truly are no reverse dependencies — state
   that explicitly in `cran-comments.md` either way (step 4).

7. **Submit** via `devtools::release()` (interactive, walks through a final
   confirmation of the above) or the CRAN web form at
   <https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html>, attaching the built tarball
   from `devtools::build()`.

## Related

- [`r-pkg-check`](../r-pkg-check/SKILL.md) — the full-check sub-step (item 1).
- [`r-pkg-news`](../r-pkg-news/SKILL.md) — the NEWS.md entry sub-step (item 3).
- [`r-pkg-spellcheck`](../r-pkg-spellcheck/SKILL.md) — run before this
  checklist so documentation and NEWS.md text are clean going in.
