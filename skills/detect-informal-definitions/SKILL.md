# detect-informal-definitions — find concepts defined only in prose

A concept can be defined with all the precision of a formal definition —
a bolded name, an equation, an `\eqdef` — and still never become one,
because the sentence stating it was never wrapped in the project's formal
definition construct. That concept has no stable id: nothing downstream
can cite it, and `definition-crossrefs.md`'s hyperlink-on-first-mention
check has nothing to link to, since as far as that check is concerned no
definition exists.

The full detection heuristic, confirmation checklist, and fix menu live in
[`shared/writing/informal-definitions.md`](../../shared/writing/informal-definitions.md) ---
read it before running this skill; the steps below are the short version.

## When this fires

- "detect informal definitions", "find informal definitions", "check for
  missing definitions", "is this concept formally defined", "this reads
  like a definition but has no div", "detect-informal-definitions", "did"
- **As part of any PR/MR review, or self-review before a push, that
  introduces new technical content** — run alongside
  `definition-crossrefs.md`'s formal-crossref-div ordering check,
  `fix-forward-references`, `fact-check-prose`, and `find-ai-tells`.

## Procedure

1. **Identify the target.** A file, a PR/MR diff, or pasted prose that
   introduces new technical content.
2. **Grep for candidates** using the two patterns in
   [`informal-definitions.md`](../../shared/writing/informal-definitions.md#the-detection-heuristic) ---
   a bolded term followed by defining language (`\eqdef`, "is the", "="),
   and a naming sentence ending "is:"/"are:" immediately before a display
   equation. Run both; each catches phrasing the other misses.
3. **For each hit, find its enclosing div** (search backward for the
   nearest `:::{#...}` opener, forward for its matching closer). It's a
   candidate if it sits in no formal-definition div at all, or if it sits
   inside a *different* concept's div (riding along inside someone else's
   definition).
4. **Confirm each candidate** against the checklist in the fragment: is it
   introducing something new (not just reusing an already-defined term)?
   Is it a practical/tool-usage aside rather than a theoretical concept?
   Is it part of a deliberately informal list? Is it actually cited
   downstream? Drop anything that fails the "new, theoretical, not-a-list,
   worth-citing" bar.
5. **Fix each confirmed finding**, per the fragment's fix menu:
   - Wrap it in its own formal-definition div, with its own id and
     heading.
   - Give it its own worked example, immediately after — before any new
     theoretical claim builds on it.
   - Update anything that already depended on it informally to cite the
     new id explicitly.
   - If it was riding along inside a different concept's div, split it
     out into its own div rather than leaving both sharing one id.
6. **Re-scan** the touched section after editing — a newly-added
   definition can itself introduce a forward reference (see
   `fix-forward-references`) if its worked example isn't moved to sit
   right after it.
7. **Report.** For each finding: the term, its location, whether it had no
   div at all or was riding along inside another's, the fix applied (new
   div id, new example, updated citations), and the diff.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`shared/writing/definition-crossrefs.md`** (cited from `CLAUDE.md`'s
  "Hyperlink technical terms and results" section, not a standalone skill)
  --- assumes the defining div already exists and checks that mentions
  link to it in the right order, flagging a term as "undefined" only when
  no div states it *anywhere*. This skill runs conceptually first: it
  catches prose that reads like a definition but never became a div at
  all, which is exactly the case `definition-crossrefs.md`'s div-position
  comparison has nothing to compare.
- **`fix-forward-references`** --- a concept without its own div can't be
  crossref'd, which is exactly what forces an author into a forward-
  pointing phrase ("the definition below") instead of a working link.
  Fixing this skill's findings often removes a forward reference for free;
  run both on a diff that touches definitions.
- **`fact-check-prose`** / **`check-info-quality`** --- sibling prose-rigor
  checks; run this alongside them on a diff that introduces new technical
  content.
- **`ard` / `ardi`** --- when reviewing a PR/MR, or self-reviewing before a
  push, apply this check alongside the other prose-review rules `CLAUDE.md`
  lists.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Flagging every bolded term as a missing definition --- most bolded
  text is emphasis on a term already formally defined elsewhere; check for
  an existing div before flagging.
- ❌ Treating a practical tool-usage explanation (what a function argument
  or CLI flag does) as a theoretical concept needing a formal div.
- ❌ Flagging items in a deliberately informal list (a "practical
  considerations" or "gotchas" section) that the surrounding content
  already signals isn't the formal-definitions section.
- ❌ Wrapping a confirmed finding in a div without also giving it a worked
  example --- a definition with no example is still incomplete by this
  project's own content-writing conventions.
- ❌ Leaving a split-out concept's new example after, instead of
  immediately after, its new definition --- reintroduces the forward-
  reference problem this skill is meant to help avoid.
