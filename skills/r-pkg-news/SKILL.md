# r-pkg-news

Drafts a new `NEWS.md` entry for an R package, matching the package's
existing entry style and format — as opposed to `r-pkg-spellcheck`, which
only spellchecks `NEWS.md` text that's already there and never helps author
it.

**Why this exists:** most R packages track user-facing changes in
`NEWS.md`, one entry per release or per notable change, but the exact
format (bullet style, whether entries are grouped under a version heading,
whether they reference issue/PR numbers) varies package to package. Writing
a new entry that doesn't match the existing style creates visible
inconsistency the next release notices.

## Procedure

1. **Confirm this is an R package.** Check that `DESCRIPTION` exists at the
   repo root, and that `NEWS.md` (or `NEWS`) exists. If either is missing,
   skip — this skill doesn't apply, or the package needs to add
   `NEWS.md` first (a one-line file with a version heading and no entries
   is enough to start).

2. **Read the existing style.** Look at the last 2–3 entries in
   `NEWS.md` and note:
   - Whether entries sit under a version heading (`# pkgname 1.2.3`) that's
     already there for the in-progress version, or need a new one.
   - Bullet format (`* `, `- `), sentence case vs. lowercase lead word,
     whether entries end with a period.
   - Whether entries cite the author, an issue number, or a PR number
     (e.g. `(#123)`, `(@username)`), and where in the sentence that
     citation goes.

3. **Gather what changed.** Pull recent commits since the last tagged
   release (`git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline`) or the PR description
   supplied by the user, and identify the user-facing changes worth an
   entry — skip pure-internal refactors, CI-only changes, and typo fixes
   that don't affect behavior unless the project's own style includes
   those too (check step 2's precedent).

4. **Draft the entry** matching the style read in step 2, one bullet per
   user-facing change, in plain, direct language (what changed and why it
   matters to a user — not an internal implementation narrative). Add it
   under the current in-progress version heading, creating that heading if
   this is the first entry for the next version.

5. **Spellcheck the new text** — hand off to
   [`r-pkg-spellcheck`](../r-pkg-spellcheck/SKILL.md) before finishing, since
   new NEWS.md prose is exactly the case that skill exists to check before
   `git push`.

- [`r-pkg-spellcheck`](../r-pkg-spellcheck/SKILL.md) spellchecks `NEWS.md`
  text against `inst/WORDLIST`; run it after drafting a new entry here.
- [`r-pkg-check`](../r-pkg-check/SKILL.md) and
  [`r-pkg-cran-checklist`](../r-pkg-cran-checklist/SKILL.md) both expect an
  up-to-date `NEWS.md` entry for the release under check — this skill is
  the step that produces it.
