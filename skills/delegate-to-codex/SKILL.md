# delegate-to-codex — run heavy sidecar work on codex, not Claude

Standing rule: for heavy, parallelizable read / draft / verify work, spend the
separately-billed **`codex` CLI** (ChatGPT plan) first and keep Claude budget in
reserve. Claude stays the orchestrator — it writes the prompts, assembles the
stages, integrates the outputs — and is the **fallback** for anything codex
can't finish. Exhaust the *current 5-hour codex window*, then fall back to Claude
until the window resets. This skill is the mechanism; the preference lives in
`memories/preferences.md` ("Delegate heavy work to codex first").

## When this fires

- "delegate to codex", "use codex", "run this on codex", "do this with codex",
  "offload to codex", "codex-first", "dtc"
- Proactively, before any **heavy fan-out** read/analysis/verify pass (scoping a
  backlog, auditing many files, drafting N artifacts, adversarially verifying
  findings) that would otherwise spend Claude/Workflow tokens.

## When NOT to delegate

- A focused authoring/judgment task that needs Claude's own context and
  conventions (e.g. writing one skill, one PR body) — do it inline.
- The critical-path edit the rest of the work waits on — keep it local so
  progress doesn't block on a codex round-trip.
- codex is unavailable or the 5-hour window is already exhausted (see step 4).

## Procedure

### 1. Confirm codex is available and in-window

```bash
codex --version            # binary at ~/.local/bin/codex
codex login status         # expect "Logged in using ChatGPT"
```

If your setup runs sessions under a cluster/HPC allocation, launch agent-scale
codex work on a compute node or allocation, not a shared login node. If login
fails or the account is out of quota, skip to step 4 (fall back to Claude).

### 2. Prepare prompts (and a schema for structured output)

Write each task's prompt to a file, and — when you need machine-readable results
back — a JSON Schema so codex is forced to emit conforming JSON:

```bash
WORK=<scratchpad>/codex-run           # a scratchpad dir, not the repo
mkdir -p "$WORK/out"
# ... write "$WORK/prompt_<id>.txt" per task, and "$WORK/schema.json" if structured
```

Fetch anything from the network yourself (e.g. `gh issue view`) and embed it in
the prompt — `-s read-only` keeps codex from mutating the repo, and you should
not rely on it having network/tooling for setup.

### 3. Run codex — background + poll for anything non-trivial

A single quick call runs in the foreground:

```bash
codex exec -C <repo> -s read-only --skip-git-repo-check \
  -o "$WORK/out/<id>.json" --output-schema "$WORK/schema.json" \
  - < "$WORK/prompt_<id>.txt"
```

- `-s read-only` for read/analyze/verify (codex can still run `rg`/`cat` to
  explore); drop to a writable sandbox only for a task that must edit.
- `-o <file>` captures the final message; `--output-schema <file>` forces JSON.
- stdin `-` feeds a long prompt.

Verify these flags against your installed `codex-cli` version (`codex exec
--help`) — flag names can shift between releases.

**codex takes ~2–4 min per task, which exceeds the foreground tool timeout** —
so for multi-item or long work, run a **background orchestrator** and poll a
DONE marker (a `nohup … &` launcher returns immediately, so its completion
signal is NOT the run finishing — poll the marker instead):

```bash
cat > "$WORK/run.sh" <<'RUN'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
WORK="<scratchpad>/codex-run"; REPO="<repo>"; MAXPAR=3
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
rm -f "$WORK/DONE" "$WORK/status.log"
run_one() {
  local id="$1" start=$SECONDS rc sz flag=""
  codex exec -C "$REPO" -s read-only --skip-git-repo-check \
    -o "$WORK/out/$id.json" --output-schema "$WORK/schema.json" \
    - < "$WORK/prompt_$id.txt" > "$WORK/out/$id.codexlog" 2>&1
  rc=$?; sz=$(wc -c < "$WORK/out/$id.json" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  grep -qiE "rate limit|quota|usage limit|spend cap|429|too many requests" "$WORK/out/$id.codexlog" && flag="EXHAUSTED"
  echo "$id rc=$rc bytes=$sz $flag" >> "$WORK/status.log"
}
for id in <ids…>; do
  run_one "$id" &
  while [ "$(jobs -rp | wc -l)" -ge "$MAXPAR" ]; do sleep 2; done
done
wait; touch "$WORK/DONE"
RUN
chmod +x "$WORK/run.sh"
nohup bash "$WORK/run.sh" > "$WORK/runner.log" 2>&1 &
```

Then poll for `$WORK/DONE` in a **background Bash task** (so the wait itself
doesn't hit the foreground timeout), reading `$WORK/status.log` for per-item
exit code / byte count / `EXHAUSTED` flags.

### 4. Detect exhaustion and fall back to Claude

Treat an item as codex-failed when its `status.log` line shows a non-zero `rc`,
`bytes=0` (empty `-o`), or an `EXHAUSTED` flag. Codex exhaustion comes in **two
distinct forms**, both worth grepping for (step 3 does):

- a **rolling ~5-hour usage/rate limit** (`rate limit`, `usage limit`, `429`) —
  transient; resume on codex once the window resets;
- a **hard spend cap** set by the workspace owner (`spend cap`) — does NOT reset
  on its own; codex stays blocked until the owner raises the cap, so flag it to
  the user and stay on Claude for the rest of the run.

The grep must catch **both** — an earlier version keyed only on rate-limit
phrasing and silently missed a `spend cap` block, so the runner didn't flag it
and only reading the raw log surfaced it. For **only** the failed items, redo the
stage with a Claude `Agent` / `Workflow` — don't re-route the ones codex already
finished.

### 5. Collect and synthesize

Read the `$WORK/out/*.json` results, validate them, and integrate. Claude owns
this synthesis step — codex produced the parts, Claude assembles the whole.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`select-model`** — picks *which Claude model* for a task; this skill picks
  *whether to run it on codex at all* first. Complementary: decide codex-vs-Claude
  here, then model tier there.
- **Workflow orchestration** (the `Workflow` tool) — runs fan-out on **Claude**
  subagents. Prefer this skill's codex path first for the read/verify stages to
  conserve Claude budget; reserve `Workflow` for stages codex can't do or once
  its window is exhausted.
- **`ums` / `record-learnings`** — capture any new codex mechanics learned into
  the backing memory so this skill stays current.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Running codex in the foreground for a multi-minute task — the tool timeout
  kills it mid-run; background + poll a DONE marker instead.
- ❌ Trusting a `nohup … &` launcher's immediate "completion" as the run
  finishing — poll the marker, not the launcher.
- ❌ Re-routing codex-finished items back through Claude on a partial failure —
  fall back only for the items that actually failed.
- ❌ Spending Claude/Workflow tokens on heavy fan-out read/verify while the codex
  5-hour window still has budget.
- ❌ Delegating a focused authoring/judgment task that needs Claude's own context
  (write those inline).
