name: pr-status-all
description: Print a table summarizing the true status of every open PR in the repo — for each one, read the LATEST review comment (not a cached verdict) and parse it for remaining findings, alongside CI state and whether the branch is behind main. Gathers the per-PR signals concurrently (one subagent per PR). Use when asked "summarize all open PRs", "status table of my PRs", "what's the state of every PR", "give me a PR dashboard", or any whole-queue status overview. For a single PR use `pr-status`; to actually drive PRs to clean use `ardia`.

# pr-status-all

Produce a **one-row-per-PR status table** for all open PRs. This is the
whole-queue version of [`pr-status`](../pr-status/SKILL.md): apply the same
"read the **latest** review and parse it for findings" discipline to every
open PR, then lay the results out as a table. It is **read-only** — it reports
status, it does not push, merge, or run review loops (use
[`ardia`](../ardia/SKILL.md) for that, or
[`sync-pr-branch`](../sync-pr-branch/SKILL.md) to update a branch).

Because the per-PR signals are independent and read-only, gather them
**concurrently** — one subagent per PR — then assemble the table. See
*Why fan-out is safe here* for why this loop parallelizes and the write-loops
don't.

## When this fires

- "summarize all open PRs", "status table / dashboard of my PRs",
  "what's the state of every open PR", "which PRs are ready to merge".
- Whenever you'd otherwise report on more than one PR at once.

## CI green ≠ review clean

`gh pr checks <N>` going green is about **CI state**, not the review verdict. A
PR can have every check passing and still carry unaddressed review findings.
Report CI state and review verdict as **separate columns** — never collapse
them into one "OK".

## Procedure

### 1. Enumerate the open PRs (orchestrator, one cheap call)

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,isDraft \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.number)\t\(.headRefName)\t\(.isDraft)\t\(.title)"'   # LIST_PRS
```

This is fast and sequential — a single call to get the work units.

### 2. Fan out — one subagent per PR (concurrent)

Spawn **one subagent per open PR, all in a single batch** (multiple `Agent`
calls in one message) so they run at once. The fan-out is read-only, so it
needs **no worktrees** — each subagent only reads PR signals, nothing mutates,
and there is nothing to collide on.

Give each subagent its PR number and `headRefName`, and have it gather the
**six independent signals** below and return one structured row. Carry the
disciplines into the prompt — a subagent that doesn't follow *Read the LATEST
review* will silently misreport:

A subagent starts **fresh** — it sees only this prompt, not this skill file —
so **inline the exact commands**; don't point it at a section it can't read.
Fill in `<N>`, `<headRefName>`, `<owner>`, `<repo>` for each PR (resolve
owner/repo once with `gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'`):

> Gather the status of PR **#<N>** (branch `<headRefName>`) in this repo and
> return a single structured row. Do not push, merge, or modify anything.
>
> 1. **Latest review verdict, checked for currency against the head.** Read
>    the *most recent* review comment **and** the timestamp of the latest
>    commit, in one call, so a "clean" verdict posted before the last push
>    can't be mistaken for current:
>    ```bash
>    gh pr view "<N>" --json comments,commits,headRefOid \
>      --jq '{review: ([.comments[] | select(.author.login | startswith("claude"))] | last), lastCommitDate: (.commits[-1].committedDate), headRefOid: .headRefOid}'
>    ```
>    **This fetches more than `READ_PR_COMMENTS` maps to** --
>    [`tool-mappings.md`](../../tool-mappings.md)'s entry for that token is a
>    comments-only MCP call, which returns neither `commits` nor
>    `headRefOid`. In a remote/MCP session without `gh`, fetch those two
>    fields with a separate call rather than assuming the token mapping
>    covers this expanded query.
>    The reviewer login varies by setup: `gh pr view` reports `claude`; the
>    REST API reports `claude[bot]`. `startswith("claude")` matches both. If
>    `.review` is `null`, the reviewer may post as `github-actions[bot]` or
>    another login -- **never report "clean"**; broaden the filter or say no
>    review was found.
>    **If `.review.createdAt` is earlier than `.lastCommitDate`, the review
>    predates the latest push** -- report `in-flight`, not the review body's
>    verdict, regardless of what it says (both are ISO 8601 UTC timestamps, so
>    a plain string comparison works).
>    **This timing comparison is best-effort, not proof** -- a review run
>    *started* against an older commit can finish and post *after* a newer
>    push lands, making `createdAt` look current even though the reviewed
>    content is stale (issue comments carry no structured `commit_id` to
>    check directly, unlike formal reviews). When the review body names the
>    commit it reviewed (the `@claude` bot commonly writes "commit `<sha>`"),
>    cross-check that mentioned SHA's prefix against `.headRefOid` (now part
>    of the same call above) as a
>    corroborating signal; treat a mismatch as `in-flight` even if the
>    timing check alone would have said `clean`.
>    **When no SHA can be extracted from the body, don't fall back to trusting
>    the timing check alone as proof of currency** -- report `unverified`
>    (not `clean`) instead, since `committedDate` is the commit's local
>    committer timestamp, not when GitHub received the push, and a commit
>    authored earlier but pushed later can pass the timing check while still
>    being newer than the review.
>    Only once the review postdates the last commit **and** a named SHA
>    matches -- unconditionally; no SHA named means `unverified`, not
>    `clean`, full stop -- apply the bar for
>    `clean`: "Looks good" / "no findings" / "approved" with zero follow-on
>    bullets under any heading. A rebuttal the reviewer still disputes is
>    **open**, not clean.
> 2. **External (Copilot) reviewer verdict -- read-only, don't request one.**
>    The comment above is the `@claude` bot only; a formal Copilot review is a
>    separate object it won't show. This step **only inspects an existing
>    Copilot review** -- it never POSTs a review request. Requesting a review
>    is a mutation (triggers a review job, consumes quota, can collide with a
>    concurrent `ardi` loop), which breaks this skill's whole justification for
>    fanning out subagents concurrently (*read-only, side-effect-free*). If no
>    genuine verdict already exists at the current head, report that fact --
>    don't try to produce one; that's `ardi`'s job.
>    ```bash
>    set -o pipefail
>    head="$(gh pr view "<N>" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)"
>    review_id="$(gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/reviews" --paginate \
>      | jq -s --arg h "$head" \
>      '[.[][] | select(.user.login=="copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]" and .commit_id==$h)] | last | .id')"
>    if [ -n "$review_id" ] && [ "$review_id" != "null" ]; then
>      gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/reviews/$review_id" --jq '{state, body}'
>      gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments" --paginate \
>        | jq -s --arg rid "$review_id" \
>        '[.[][] | select(.pull_request_review_id == ($rid | tonumber))] | .[] | {line: (.line // .original_line), body}'
>    else
>      echo "no Copilot review exists at the current head"
>    fi
>    ```
>    Clean requires **three** things: an affirmative zero-new-findings
>    overview (e.g. "generated no new comments" -- never a literally empty
>    body), zero matched inline comments, **and no "Comments suppressed due
>    to low confidence" block in the body** -- a "no new comments" overview
>    can still carry real low-confidence findings collapsed into a
>    `<details>` block that never becomes a formal inline comment (verified:
>    PR #660's review 4767752501 read "generated no new comments" while
>    carrying 3 suppressed findings). A stub-like non-answer ("ineligible",
>    "reached their quota limit") is not a verdict either.
>    **This step cannot determine *why* no Copilot verdict exists** -- it
>    can't tell "Copilot was never asked" from "Copilot is unreachable" from
>    "a self-review was posted instead." Don't guess; report the plain
>    evidence-based fact (`no verdict at head`), and leave the
>    availability/self-review judgment call to `ardi`, which actually drives
>    the PR and can request reviews.
> 3. **CI state** -- `gh pr checks <N>` (`PR_CHECKS`); name any failing/pending
>    check, don't just say "red".
> 4. **Unresolved threads** -- count open inline review threads
>    (`READ_PR_REVIEW_COMMENTS`). Run exactly:
>    ```bash
>    gh api graphql -f query='query {
>      repository(owner:"<owner>", name:"<repo>") {
>        pullRequest(number:<N>) {
>          reviewThreads(first:100) {
>            totalCount
>            nodes { isResolved }
>          }
>        }
>      }
>    }' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads as $rt |
>      ($rt.nodes | map(select(.isResolved | not)) | length) as $open |
>      if $rt.totalCount > ($rt.nodes | length)
>      then "\($open)+ open (cap)"
>      else if $open == 0 then "resolved" else "\($open) open" end
>      end'
>    ```
>    The command emits one of three normalized values: `resolved` (all threads
>    resolved), `N open` (e.g. `3 open`) — that many unresolved threads, or
>    `N+ open (cap)` — the 100-thread cap was hit, **cannot confirm clean** —
>    treat as unresolved.
> 5. **Behind main?** -- fetch the head ref too (a fresh subagent has no local
>    branch), then compare remote-tracking refs: `git fetch origin main
>    <headRefName> -q && git rev-list --count origin/<headRefName>..origin/main`.
>    >0 means main has moved ahead.
> 6. **Blocking human `CHANGES_REQUESTED`** (`READ_PR_REVIEWS` -- abstract
>    operation token; resolve to your model's tool via
>    [`tool-mappings.md`](../../tool-mappings.md)). A bot's clean verdict does
>    **not** clear a human's formal review state -- it's a separate object,
>    invisible to the Signal 1 comments query, and its top-level body is
>    often empty (the finding lives in an inline comment):
>    ```bash
>    gh pr view "<N>" --json reviews \
>      --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login != null and (.state == "APPROVED" or .state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED" or .state == "DISMISSED"))] | group_by(.author.login) | map(sort_by(.submittedAt) | last) | [.[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED") | .author.login]'
>    ```
>    **`--json reviews` returns the full review history, not one entry per
>    reviewer, and a reviewer's *decisive* state persists across neutral
>    comments** -- GitHub only clears `CHANGES_REQUESTED` when that same
>    reviewer later `APPROVED`s, or via an explicit dismissal; a neutral
>    `COMMENTED` review in between does **not** clear it. Filter to only
>    `APPROVED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED`/`DISMISSED` states *before* reducing to
>    each author's latest review -- reducing over all states first lets a
>    later `COMMENTED` round hide an earlier `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (verified
>    with a synthetic fixture: naive reduction incorrectly cleared it,
>    state-filtered reduction correctly kept it blocking). **Keep
>    `DISMISSED` in the filter** -- dropping it would let an older
>    `CHANGES_REQUESTED` outlive its own later dismissal, since the
>    dismissal itself would never survive the reduction to compete as
>    "latest" (verified with a second synthetic fixture:
>    `CHANGES_REQUESTED` then `DISMISSED` incorrectly stayed blocking under
>    an `APPROVED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED`-only filter, correctly cleared once
>    `DISMISSED` was included). The trailing `select(.state ==
>    "CHANGES_REQUESTED")` still keeps `DISMISSED` reviews themselves out of
>    the final blocking list. Any
>    non-empty result **blocks** regardless of what any bot says -- only the
>    human (or an explicit dismissal) resolves it. Return the reviewer login(s)
>    from the array, not just a count.
>
> Return: PR number, CI (✅/❌-with-name/⏳), review (`clean` / `unverified`
> / `N open` with the headline finding / `none found` / `in-flight`),
> external (`clean` / `N open` / `no verdict at head`), human-blocked
> (`none` / `N pending` -- name the reviewer if `N` > 0), threads (`resolved`
> / `N open` / `N+ open (cap)`), behind-main (`up to date` / `N commits`).

### 3. Assemble (orchestrator)

Collect the rows the subagents return and **pair each with the `title`,
`headRefName`, and `isDraft`** the orchestrator already has from step 1 (the
subagent doesn't re-fetch these), then render the table + per-PR findings list
(see *Output*) — marking draft PRs from `isDraft`. The output is **identical**
to the series version — only the way the signals are gathered changed.

### Graceful degradation to series

If subagent fan-out is unavailable (no `Agent` tool in the session), fall back
to gathering the six signals **in series** -- loop the exact same per-PR
gather (items 1-6 above, including the currency check and the human
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` check) over each PR from step 1. The output is the same;
it's just slower. Don't substitute a simplified comments-only query here --
that would silently drop the current-head and human-review guarantees the
rest of this skill relies on.

## Output

A Markdown table, one row per open PR, with these columns:

| PR | Title | Branch | CI | Review | External | Human | Threads | Behind main |

- **PR** — make the number a markdown link,
  `[#<N>](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<N>)` (repo policy — never a
  bare `#N`), so it's one-click and compact.
- **CI** — ✅ / ❌ (name the failing check) / ⏳ pending.
- **Review** -- `clean`, `unverified` (postdates the last commit by timing
  alone but no SHA could corroborate it), `N open` (with the headline
  finding), `none found` (filter didn't match / no review yet), or
  `in-flight` if a review run is still going **or** the latest review
  predates the latest commit (per subagent item 1's currency check) --
  either way, the current head hasn't been confirmed reviewed yet.
- **External** -- `clean` (a genuine, non-stub Copilot verdict at the current
  head, per subagent item 2), `N open` (findings in that verdict), or `no
  verdict at head` (no Copilot review exists yet at the current commit).
  This step is read-only and doesn't request a review, so it can't tell
  "Copilot was never asked" from "unreachable" from "a self-review covers
  it" -- report the plain fact, don't guess at the reason.
- **Human** -- `none` (no blocking human review) or `N pending` (name the
  reviewer login(s)) per subagent item 6. This overrides everything else --
  a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review blocks regardless of any bot's verdict.
- **Threads** — `resolved` (none open), `N open` (unresolved inline review
  threads), or `N+ open (cap)` (100-thread cap hit — cannot confirm clean).
- **Behind main** — `up to date` or `N commits` (offer `sync-pr-branch`).

Below the table, list each PR's open findings briefly (or "none"), and call out
anything needing action: branches behind main, failing CI, drafts, reviews
that returned `null`, or a pending human review. Do **not** label a PR "ready
to merge" unless it is
**fully clean** -- **Human is `none`** (a blocking human review overrides
everything below) *and* at least one of Review or External is `clean` at
the current head (the canonical rule needs one genuine external verdict, not
both -- a clean Claude verdict alone is sufficient, and so is a clean
Copilot verdict alone; `unverified` does **not** count as clean) *and*
neither one has open findings *and* all CI
workflows are green *and* it's not behind main *and* every inline review
thread is resolved (the only open conversation being the final all-clear and
your reply). If both Review and External come back `none found` / `no verdict
at head` / `unverified`, this skill has no evidence of a genuine external verdict at all --
report the PR as not confirmed clean and point at `ardi` to obtain one; don't
guess whether a self-review already covers it. Never hedge with "ready except
for one nit."

## Why fan-out is safe here (and the write-loops stay series)

This loop parallelizes because its units are **independent and side-effect-free**
— each PR's signals are read-only and don't depend on any other PR. The
whole-queue *write* loops are different, and deliberately stay (mostly) series:

- **`ardia` / `iterate-all`** — share one working directory, compete for CI
  runner capacity, and have human checkpoints. Parallelize only opt-in, with
  worktree isolation + bounded concurrency — not by default.
- **`gii` / `gia`** — intentionally sequential: a later issue's base branch
  depends on whether the prior MR merged, and same-file issues conflict.
  **`gip`** is the opt-in exception — it fans out only the *provably
  independent* subset (no stacking dependency, no file overlap), each subagent
  in its own worktree, and sends everything else back through `gii`.

Rule of thumb: fan out a whole-queue loop only when its units are provably
independent and don't mutate shared state — like this one.

## Notes

- Skip draft PRs from the "ready" assessment but still show them (mark as
  draft).
- One unit of work per PR: in the parallel path that's one subagent per PR; in
  the series fallback it's one gather per PR. Either way, the *output* table and
  findings list are identical.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`pr-status`** — the single-PR version; this applies its latest-review-only /
  `null`-not-clean discipline across the whole open-PR queue. (pr-status :
  pr-status-all :: `ardi` : `ardia`.)
- **`ardia` / `iterate-all`** — the *write* counterpart: actually drive every
  open PR to clean. This skill only reports; see *Why fan-out is safe here* for
  why those loops stay series.
- **`sync-pr-branch`** — offered for any PR the table flags as behind main.
