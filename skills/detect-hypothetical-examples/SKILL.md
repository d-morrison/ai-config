description: "Detect worked examples that illustrate a definition or theorem with invented, round-number quantities — 'Suppose a binary covariate Z...', 'If 20% of the exposed group experience the outcome...', 'Consider a hypothetical scenario...' — even though the document already has a real, already-loaded dataset it uses elsewhere. Greps for the recurring hypothetical/suppose/consider signal phrases and suspiciously round proportions inside a `#exm-`/`#def-` div, then confirms each hit against whether a real dataset with the needed variables is actually available, whether the example is illustrating a mechanism that doesn't need real numbers at all, and whether forcing real numbers would erase the point being taught (a deliberate edge case, a proof-of-concept before the real data is introduced).

# detect-hypothetical-examples — find invented illustrations where real data exists

A worked example can be perfectly well-formed — its own `{#exm-...}` div, a
clean derivation, correct arithmetic — and still reach for invented,
round-number quantities ("suppose 20% of the exposed group...") when the
document already loads a real dataset it uses elsewhere. That's not a wrong
example, and it's not `detect-informal-definitions`'s missing-div problem —
it's a missed opportunity to ground the teaching point in real data that was
already sitting right there.

The full detection heuristic, confirmation checklist, and fix menu live in
[`shared/writing/hypothetical-examples.md`](../../shared/writing/hypothetical-examples.md) ---
read it before running this skill; the steps below are the short version.

## When this fires

- "detect hypothetical examples", "find hypothetical examples", "replace
  hypothetical examples with real data", "is this example using made-up
  numbers", "this example should use the real dataset",
  "detect-hypothetical-examples"
- **As part of any PR/MR review, or self-review before a push, that
  introduces or edits a worked example** — run alongside
  `detect-informal-definitions`, `fix-forward-references`,
  `fact-check-prose`, and `find-ai-tells`.

## Procedure

1. **Identify the target.** A file, a PR/MR diff, or pasted prose that
   introduces or edits a worked example (an `{#exm-...}` div, or the
   equivalent in a non-Quarto project).
2. **Grep for candidates** using the patterns in
   [`hypothetical-examples.md`](../../shared/writing/hypothetical-examples.md#the-detection-heuristic) ---
   the "hypothetical"/"suppose a"/"consider a hypothetical"/"if N% of"
   signal phrases, plus suspiciously round proportions (`0.1`, `0.3`,
   `20%`) sitting inside an example or definition div.
3. **Check for a real dataset already in scope** — a `read.csv`/
   `read_csv`/`glm(...)`-style loading chunk earlier in the same document,
   or a project-level running-example dataset convention. No real dataset
   in scope at all means the hit isn't a finding — skip it.
4. **Confirm each remaining candidate** against the checklist in the
   fragment: does the loaded dataset actually have the variables this
   example needs? Is the example illustrating a general mechanism that
   never needed a specific number? Would forcing real numbers erase a
   deliberate edge case or a proof-of-concept introduced before the real
   data appears? Drop anything that fails the "real data available,
   number actually needed, no unrealizable edge case" bar.
5. **Fix each confirmed finding**, per the fragment's fix menu — recompute
   from the real dataset first; if the real effect is much weaker, search
   for a more naturally illustrative real covariate/subset before falling
   back to explicitly hedged toy numbers; verify any real substitute's
   arithmetic numerically against the actual data before publishing.
6. **Re-check the surrounding text** after substituting real numbers — a
   sentence built around the invented effect size's magnitude ("a stark
   40 percentage-point gap") often needs rewording once the real number is
   much smaller.
7. **Report.** For each finding: the phrase and location, whether a real
   substitute worked or the fix was a hedge/search-for-a-better-covariate,
   the before/after numbers, and the diff.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`detect-informal-definitions`** --- a sibling content-quality check on
  the same `#exm-`/`#def-` divs, but a different failure mode: that skill
  catches a concept defined with definitional precision that never got a
  formal div; this skill assumes the div already exists and asks whether
  its illustrative *numbers* should have come from real data instead of
  being invented.
- **`fact-check-prose`** --- verifies a document's claims and computed
  values are correct; this skill runs upstream of that, since an invented
  example can be internally consistent and still be a finding here even
  before any accuracy check applies.
- **`math-derivation-steps.md`** (cited from `CLAUDE.md`'s "math
  derivations" section, not a standalone skill) --- governs the
  completeness of a derivation's algebraic steps; run it alongside this
  skill when substituting real numbers into an existing derivation, since
  every step needs re-verifying against the new values.
- **`check-info-quality`** --- its misleading/out-of-context check (check
  C) covers a citation or statistic that misrepresents its source; this
  skill is narrower and fires even with no citation involved, whenever a
  made-up number stands in for a value the document's own data could have
  supplied.
- **`ard` / `ardi`** --- when reviewing a PR/MR, or self-reviewing before a
  push, apply this check alongside the other prose-review rules `CLAUDE.md`
  lists.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Flagging every invented number as a finding — first confirm a real
  dataset with the needed variables actually exists in scope; if none
  does, there's nothing to substitute.
- ❌ Treating an abstract statement that never needed a specific numeric
  example as a finding just because it names a general mechanism.
- ❌ Mechanically substituting real numbers into an example without
  checking whether the resulting effect size still makes the teaching
  point — silently publishing a collapsed, unpersuasive example is worse
  than flagging the tradeoff and choosing a hedge or a better covariate.
- ❌ Eyeballing a real-data substitution instead of numerically verifying
  the new arithmetic against the actual dataset.
- ❌ Leaving a stale magnitude description ("a large gap", "20 points
  higher") in the surrounding prose after the underlying numbers changed.
- ❌ Silently keeping invented numbers without hedging them, when a real
  substitute wasn't available — present a toy scenario as a toy scenario,
  not as if it were computed from data.
