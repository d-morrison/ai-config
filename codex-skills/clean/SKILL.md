description: "Codex wrapper for the ai-config Claude skill `clean`. Alias for `ardi` (\"drive to clean\"). ARD + Iterate on a single PR/MR until the review verdict is clean: read the latest review, Address/Rebut/Defer every finding, push, re-request review, repeat until zero findings. Use when asked to 'clean', 'clean this PR', 'drive to clean', or 'make this PR clean'. Not for git-branch, worktree, or code cleanup \u2014 see `clean-branches` (`cb`), `clean-worktrees` (`cw`), and `tidy` / `simplify`. Use when Codex is asked to use `clean`, `/clean`, or the corresponding ai-config/Claude skill workflow."

# clean (Codex wrapper)

This is a generated Codex wrapper around the canonical ai-config Claude skill.

Source: [skills/clean/SKILL.md](../../skills/clean/SKILL.md)

Before acting, read the source skill completely and follow its workflow, adapting it to Codex.

The source lives at `skills/clean/SKILL.md` in the same ai-config checkout as this wrapper. If this wrapper was loaded through `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/clean`, resolve the symlink target for this wrapper directory first, then read `../../skills/clean/SKILL.md` relative to that real directory. Do not resolve that relative path from inside `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`, because it points back at the wrapper tree.

- Treat `user-invocable` and `allowed-tools` as Claude metadata, not Codex permissions.
- Use the tools available in this Codex session for equivalent operations.
- If the source mentions a Claude-only path such as `~/.claude/skills`, use this repository's `skills/` path while editing.
- Keep procedural changes in the canonical source skill unless the user specifically asks to change this wrapper.
