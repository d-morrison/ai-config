description: "Codex wrapper for the ai-config Claude skill `gi`. Grab Issue: pick the highest-priority open issue from the repo's tracker (re-triaging if helpful), implement it on a branch, open an MR/PR, and ARDI it to clean. Use when asked to 'gi', 'grab an issue', 'pick up the next issue', 'work on the top issue', or 'what should I work on next?' Use when Codex is asked to use `gi`, `/gi`, or the corresponding ai-config/Claude skill workflow."

# gi (Codex wrapper)

This is a generated Codex wrapper around the canonical ai-config Claude skill.

Source: [skills/gi/SKILL.md](../../skills/gi/SKILL.md)

Before acting, read the source skill completely and follow its workflow, adapting it to Codex.

The source lives at `skills/gi/SKILL.md` in the same ai-config checkout as this wrapper. If this wrapper was loaded through `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/gi`, resolve the symlink target for this wrapper directory first, then read `../../skills/gi/SKILL.md` relative to that real directory. Do not resolve that relative path from inside `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`, because it points back at the wrapper tree.

- Treat `user-invocable` and `allowed-tools` as Claude metadata, not Codex permissions.
- Use the tools available in this Codex session for equivalent operations.
- If the source mentions a Claude-only path such as `~/.claude/skills`, use this repository's `skills/` path while editing.
- Keep procedural changes in the canonical source skill unless the user specifically asks to change this wrapper.
