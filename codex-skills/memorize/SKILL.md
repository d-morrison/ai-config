description: "Codex wrapper for the ai-config Claude skill `memorize`. Persist a fact or preference to memory that survives across sessions, machines, and agents \u2014 routed by relevance to project-specific or general scope. Use when the user says 'memorize', 'remember that \u2026', '/remember', 'from now on \u2026', 'always/never \u2026', 'note that \u2026', or 'add to memories'. (`remember` / `/remember` and `always` / `/always` are synonyms.) Use when Codex is asked to use `memorize`, `/memorize`, or the corresponding ai-config/Claude skill workflow."

# memorize (Codex wrapper)

This is a generated Codex wrapper around the canonical ai-config Claude skill.

Source: [skills/memorize/SKILL.md](../../skills/memorize/SKILL.md)

Before acting, read the source skill completely and follow its workflow, adapting it to Codex.

The source lives at `skills/memorize/SKILL.md` in the same ai-config checkout as this wrapper. If this wrapper was loaded through `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/memorize`, resolve the symlink target for this wrapper directory first, then read `../../skills/memorize/SKILL.md` relative to that real directory. Do not resolve that relative path from inside `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`, because it points back at the wrapper tree.

- Treat `user-invocable` and `allowed-tools` as Claude metadata, not Codex permissions.
- Use the tools available in this Codex session for equivalent operations.
- If the source mentions a Claude-only path such as `~/.claude/skills`, use this repository's `skills/` path while editing.
- Keep procedural changes in the canonical source skill unless the user specifically asks to change this wrapper.
