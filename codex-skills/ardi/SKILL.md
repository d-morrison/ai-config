description: "Codex wrapper for the ai-config Claude skill `ardi`. ARD + Iterate: apply the ARD framework within an iterate loop on a single PR/MR. Read the latest review, Address/Rebut/Defer every finding, push fixes, post the ARD summary, then re-request review \u2014 repeating until the verdict is clean. Use when asked to 'ardi', 'dc', 'drive', 'clean', 'drive to clean', 'iterate', 'iterate until clean', 'iterate this MR', 'drive this PR to clean', 'address the review comments', '@claude review again and fix what it finds', or after receiving a review you want to resolve completely / carry a PR all the way to mergeable. Use when Codex is asked to use `ardi`, `/ardi`, or the corresponding ai-config/Claude skill workflow."

# ardi (Codex wrapper)

This is a generated Codex wrapper around the canonical ai-config Claude skill.

Source: [skills/ardi/SKILL.md](../../skills/ardi/SKILL.md)

Before acting, read the source skill completely and follow its workflow, adapting it to Codex.

The source lives at `skills/ardi/SKILL.md` in the same ai-config checkout as this wrapper. If this wrapper was loaded through `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/ardi`, resolve the symlink target for this wrapper directory first, then read `../../skills/ardi/SKILL.md` relative to that real directory. Do not resolve that relative path from inside `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`, because it points back at the wrapper tree.

- Treat `user-invocable` and `allowed-tools` as Claude metadata, not Codex permissions.
- Use the tools available in this Codex session for equivalent operations.
- If the source mentions a Claude-only path such as `~/.claude/skills`, use this repository's `skills/` path while editing.
- Keep procedural changes in the canonical source skill unless the user specifically asks to change this wrapper.
