# Built from the SAME LEAD machinery the matching passes use, not a hand-rolled

# of what may precede a command word, so `sudo -u x bash <<EOF`, `timeout 30
# bash <<EOF`, `nice bash <<EOF` and `xargs bash <<EOF` all failed the anchor

# The permissive one is not merely wider, it is the CORRECT direction here.
# This anchor decides whether to MASK, and over-detecting an executor means
# declining to mask -- so the body is scanned rather than skipped. A false
# positive costs a scan; a false negative hides a merge. That asymmetry is the
# reverse of pass 1's, which is why the MASKING side is permissive while the
# MATCHING side keeps the narrow lead.
# One anchor for "an executor is invoked here", shared by both masking
# decisions -- now literally the same compiled object, not two built from a
# common part. Rolling a second one produced round 5's gap and round 6's; the

# ordinary bash that run the body -- and all of them failed a forward-only scan,
# so the body was masked as prose and the merge ran.
#
# What the decision actually needs is CO-OCCURRENCE: this line introduces a

    at all in the body, so nothing in it can execute: it is inert text and is
    masked in full. An UNQUOTED delimiter (`<<EOF`) does expand, so only the
    literal prose is masked and `$(...)` / backtick substitutions are left live,
    exactly as mask_subexpressions does for payload flags.

    Without this a heredoc carrying prose ABOUT a merge command was matched as
    one -- which is how filing ai-config#1279 was itself blocked, by the guard
    matching its own refusal text quoted inside a `gh issue create` heredoc.

    But "inert text" is a claim about the CONSUMER, not about the heredoc. A
    body fed to a shell (`bash <<EOF`, `ssh host <<EOF`) is a script, and
    masking it hid a real merge from both later passes -- the quoted-delimiter
    form included, since `<<'EOF'` suppresses expansion and bash still runs
    what it reads. Those are left untouched; see HEREDOC_EXECUTOR.
