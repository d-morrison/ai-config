"""Test the no-unreviewed-pr guard.

The guard's value is concentrated in the negative cases: a draft PR
legitimately defers review, and a session that already requested a reviewer
must not be nagged. A guard that fires on correct behaviour gets disabled,
and then the case it exists for goes unprotected too.

Fixtures mirror real transcripts: every tool_use carries an `id`, and every
tool_result references it via `tool_use_id`, because the guard correlates a
result to its own call by identity. Crucially, a `gh pr create` command does
NOT embed its PR number -- the number arrives only in the command's result --
so the create fixtures deliberately keep the number OUT of the command and
put it in the result, the shape the position/number-in-command model got
wrong.
