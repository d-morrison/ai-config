"""Stop-hook guard: catch opening a PR without requesting a reviewer.

Opening a PR auto-triggers the repo's *own* review workflow, so review
genuinely is in motion -- for that half. It does NOT summon Copilot, which
reviews only when explicitly requested. The auto-triggered half running is
exactly what disguises the missing half: the PR shows review-shaped activity
in its checks while no reviewer has read the diff.

That matters more here than in most repos, because `claude-review` on this
repo's own PRs has failed on every run that actually attempted a review this
session (ai-config#897). Whatever the cause -- #897 calls prompt overflow only
the leading hypothesis, states the literal error is unconfirmed, and reports
15 successful runs on six other branches -- the observed effect stands on its
own: when it fails, Copilot is the only working reviewer, so a PR opened
without an explicit request gets no review at all.

The condition is exactly decidable from the transcript, which is why this is
a hook rather than a rule to remember:

    a PR was created or marked ready this session
    AND no reviewer request came after it

Correlation is by tool_use identity, not by position or by a scalar
timestamp. Three facts make that necessary, each an independently-reproduced
bug in the position/timestamp model this replaces:

  * A `gh pr create` command cannot carry its own PR number -- the number
    only appears in the command's RESULT. So the open is keyed from its
    result (URL or `number` field), by tool_use id, not from the command.
  * A reviewer request is discharged only by ITS OWN successful result,
    matched by tool_use id -- not by the first result in a batch, which may
    belong to an unrelated tool.
  * A read of the `requested_reviewers` endpoint (a GET) is not a request;
    only a mutating POST (or a `--reviewer`/`--add-reviewer`/
    `request_copilot_review` form) discharges the obligation.

Obligations carry owner/repo when the transcript provides it, so the same PR
number in two repositories is two obligations, not one.

Fails OPEN on any parse trouble, and fires at most once per distinct message
per transcript, so it cannot wedge a session.

# A gh action must be an actual command word, not a string quoted inside a
# DIFFERENT command's argument. This repo's own docs and this hook's own
# recovery text are full of literal `gh pr create` / `requested_reviewers -X
# POST` examples, so a `gh pr comment --body "... gh pr create ..."` would
# otherwise forge an obligation, and a `--body "... requested_reviewers -X
# POST ..."` would silently DISCHARGE a real one -- the exact false negative
# this hook exists to catch (the README.md:265-271 heredoc trap, one layer in
# from the non-shell-tool case).
#
# Open/draft detection and request detection defend against that differently,
# because they key on structurally different things:
#
#   * RX_OPEN/RX_DRAFT key on `gh pr create`/`ready`, always a LEADING command
#     word, never legitimately inside quotes. So for them every quoted span is
#     blanked (`_scrub_all`) before matching -- that neutralises an example
#     create quoted in a `--body` AND a bare `echo "gh pr create"`, with no
#     risk to a real open, whose command word is never quoted.
#   * Request detection keys on `requested_reviewers`/`-X POST`, which are the
#     STRUCTURAL argv of the hook's OWN recovery command
#     (`gh api "repos/o/r/pulls/N/requested_reviewers" -X POST`) -- double-
#     quoting a `gh api` URL is standard shell, so blanking every quote there
#     erases a genuine request and the hook nags forever after the user does
#     exactly what it asked (round 4's regression). But those same tokens also
#     appear inside ordinary string arguments -- `echo "... -X POST"`, a
#     `gh pr comment` body, a heredoc/herestring -- where they are NOT a
#     request. Blanking only known payload flags (round 5) missed every other
#     embedding mechanism. So request detection instead PARSES the command into
#     simple commands and inspects each one's argv (`request_ident`), matching
#     the request tokens only when they are the argv of an actual `gh api`/
#     `gh pr edit`/`gh pr create` invocation -- never the value of a string
#     argument. That closes the class rather than the next instance of it.
#
# Over-blanking (open/draft) only ever DROPS a match -- a missed obligation,
# the fail-open direction -- never forges or discharges one. Request parsing
# fails toward NOT-a-request (a shlex error or unrecognised form leaves the
# obligation outstanding and the hook warns), so it never silently discharges.

# attaches to the command it decorates rather than terminating it, so treating
# `>` as a separator split a genuinely-sole request with a trailing `> /dev/null`

# on this NARROWER signal: an actual API-failure SHAPE (a 4xx status or GitHub's
# "cannot be requested"), plus the tool call's own is_error exit status. A
# genuinely failed `gh api`/`gh pr edit` request exits non-zero (is_error) or
# returns a 4xx, so this still catches every real failure without firing on a
# neighbouring command's stderr.
# The `\\?\"` before/after `status` tolerates the escaped-quote shape a string
# tool-result body takes once `json.dumps()` wraps it (`\"status\":422`), as
# well as an unescaped `"status":422`; without it this 4xx alternative was dead
# for the ordinary string-content case and only `HTTP 4\d\d`/`is_error` caught a
