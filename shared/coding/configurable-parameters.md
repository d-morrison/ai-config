Make every parameter configurable.
A quantity a caller could reasonably want to vary --- a size, a count, a
layout, a timing, a threshold, a spawn geometry --- should enter through a
function parameter, a constructor/instance field, or a data file, with
today's value kept as the default. Never bury it as a bare literal inside
the implementation where only an edit to that function's own source can
change it.

## The exemption

**Universal physical constants** (the speed of light, Avogadro's number,
unit-conversion factors between fixed units) and **true mathematical
constants** (pi, e) are exempt from being caller-configurable --- no caller
has a legitimate reason to want a different one, ever. The test: would a
caller ever legitimately want a different value for a different call, run,
or configuration? If yes, it's a parameter. If the value is fixed by the
physical world or by mathematics itself and cannot vary by context, it
doesn't need to be a parameter --- but exempt from configurability isn't
license to hand-type an approximation: use the language or library's own
named constant (`Math.PI`, `np.pi`, `scipy.constants.c`), not a duplicated
literal that can drift from the canonical value or its precision.

**Not exempt: quantities that are measured or vary by context.** Local
gravitational acceleration varies by latitude and altitude (a caller
modeling a specific location may need a different `g`); a material
property varies by material and environment (a caller working with a
different material needs a different value). These look constant at a
single call site, but they still fail the variability test above --- a
different caller, a different location, or a different material
legitimately wants a different number. Treat them as parameters with the
commonly used value as the default, not as exemptions.

## Distinct from avoid-hardcoding-external-data

This is a different axis from
[`avoid-hardcoding-external-data`](avoid-hardcoding-external-data.md), which
is about duplicated **ownership** of a fact that already has an external
source of truth (a version number, a package list). This rule is about
**variability**: a value can have no external owner at all --- it's a
constant this project chose --- and still be a parameter, because some
future caller will legitimately want a different value for their own
call site. The two checks compose: a value can fail either, both, or
neither.

## Why

A compile-time or hard-coded constant shared across every caller forces
every future change in scope to become a global, code-editing change ---
and when call sites have accumulated downstream state that assumes the old
value (timing, layout, positioning baked into other artifacts), that
edit can cascade into a large, unplanned retiming/rework sweep instead of
a single call-site argument change.
(Lacaedemon/sparta#946 changed a shared compile-time battlefield-size
constant and had to audit all 19 default-spawn demo clips, retargeting or
retiming 8 of them that had baked in the old geometry;
Lacaedemon/sparta#964 later moved to per-battle map definitions so this
class of change no longer needs a repo-wide clip sweep.)

## In review

Flag a new hard-coded tunable in a diff as a standard review finding, the
same weight as the other `shared/coding` rules: name the value, confirm it
isn't one of the two exemptions above, and ask for it to become a
parameter/field/data value with the current value as its default.
