Fail fast; no silent failures.
Detect bad state as early as possible and stop with a clear error,
rather than proceeding and letting the failure surface later — or
never — as silently wrong output.

## In code

- Validate inputs and assumptions at the top of a function —
  `stopifnot()`, or `rlang::abort()` with a clear message — instead of
  letting a bad value flow into a confusing downstream error or, worse,
  a plausible-looking wrong result.
- Don't swallow errors.
  A bare `except:` in Python, an R
  `tryCatch(..., error = function(e) NULL)`, or a shell `|| true` hides
  the failure without fixing it.
- When a fallback is genuinely wanted — graceful degradation at a
  system boundary, a retry for a known-transient failure — make it
  explicit and observable: message the degradation, bound the retries,
  and document why the fallback is safe.
- In CI, a step that can fail should fail the job, not
  `continue-on-error` its way to a green check.
  The exception is a deliberate pattern that re-checks the outcome
  downstream (e.g. `d-morrison/gha`'s `continue-on-error` review
  attempts feeding a single resolve-outcome step that still fails the
  job when neither attempt succeeded) — the failure is deferred and
  handled, not ignored.

## In review

Flag error handling that hides failure — swallowed exceptions, silent
defaults substituted on failure, unbounded retries, `continue-on-error`
without a downstream outcome check — the same weight as any other
standing review check.
Ask for the explicit form: an early validation, a loud error, or a
documented, observable fallback.

This serves the Reliable goal in the
[principles catalog](README.md): a loud failure is easier to catch than
a silent one.
