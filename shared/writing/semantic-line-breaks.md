Break lines in prose at major phrase and sentence boundaries — one clause
per line, roughly 60 to 80 characters — rather than wrapping at a fixed
column or writing one long line per paragraph. This matters most in files
under version control (Quarto `.qmd`, Markdown docs, and similar), since a
semantic break keeps a diff to the changed sentence instead of a whole
reflowed paragraph.

**When editing existing prose**, preserve the file's current line breaks
exactly — don't reflow to a single long line or a different wrap width.
**When writing new prose**, add breaks at phrase/sentence boundaries as you
go.

**When a review flags a semantic-line-break violation, fix every
over-length line in the touched section in one pass** — not just the
specifically-flagged ones. Review bots (`@claude` / Copilot) re-scan on
each push and flag the next batch of adjacent borderline lines the prior
round left alone, so fixing only what was named drags the PR through round
after round of the same finding (asymptotic noise; UCD-SERG/lab-manual#297
took five review rounds this way).

**URL-inflation exception:** a line that runs long *only* because of an
embedded `[text](long-url)` link — where the visible prose before the link
is well under 40 characters — is fine as-is. Don't force an awkward
mid-clause break just to shorten the raw line; review bots themselves
classify these as borderline / acceptable.

**When reviewing prose, suggest semantic-line-break fixes — don't insist on
them.** Flag lines that ignore clause/sentence boundaries as a style
suggestion, the same weight as a word-choice nit: worth raising, not worth
blocking approval over, and not worth re-raising if the author declines.
This is distinct from the rule above: that one governs how thoroughly to
fix violations once a review has flagged them; this one governs the
weight to give the finding when you are the reviewer in the first place.
