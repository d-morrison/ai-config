When reviewing prose, math, or code, check for unnecessary complexity ---
not just correctness or clarity of meaning. Flag content that is harder
to read, derive, or maintain than the problem requires, and propose a
concrete simpler equivalent rather than just naming the complexity.

This is a review-time check on content that already exists, not a
writing-time style default. [`plain-prose.md`](../writing/plain-prose.md)
and [`avoid-nesting.md`](../coding/avoid-nesting.md) shape a first draft;
this fragment catches complexity that survives those defaults anyway --- a
derivation that grew a special case nobody removed, an abstraction added
for a future need that never arrived, a paragraph that restates its own
point three times. Something can pass every write-time default and still
be more complex than the current problem needs.

## What to check

1. **Prose.** Look for circumlocution beyond any single overlong sentence:
   a point restated from multiple angles, a definition nested behind three
   qualifiers when one would do, a section that could be a sentence. This
   goes further than `plain-prose.md`'s per-sentence rules --- it asks
   whether the *passage as a whole* carries more words than its content
   needs, not just whether one sentence is tangled.
2. **Math.** Look for a derivation, proof, or notation more elaborate than
   the result requires: proving a general case when only a specific one is
   used, carrying an index or symbol the rest of the argument never needs,
   a multi-step derivation where a known identity or direct substitution
   gets there in fewer steps. This differs from `fact-check-prose.md`'s
   reasoning check --- that check asks whether each step *follows*; this
   one asks whether a *correct* derivation is also the *simplest* correct
   one.
3. **Code.** Look for convoluted control flow, an abstraction layer that
   adds indirection without earning it (a wrapper that only forwards to
   one callee, a config system built for variation the codebase never
   exercises), and redundant intermediate steps that don't change the
   result. This is broader than `avoid-nesting.md` (nested calls/
   definitions only), and it's a *standing review check* --- not
   `simplify`'s narrow dead-code-after-refactor sweep, and not `tidy`'s
   separate on-demand audit. Fold this into every normal review pass
   instead of waiting for either to be invoked.

## What to report

1. **What's overcomplicated**, with its location --- quote or point to the
   specific passage, derivation step, or code span.
2. **The concrete simplification**, not just the observation that
   something is complex --- show the simpler prose, notation, or code, or
   describe it precisely enough that the author can apply it without
   re-deriving it.
3. **Why nothing is lost** --- confirm the simplification keeps every
   feature, edge case, and precision the original carried; never trade
   correctness or an honest hedge for brevity.

Silence on a needlessly complex passage reads as "this is as simple as it
needs to be" --- don't let a correct-but-bloated derivation or a
three-layer wrapper through unchallenged just because it isn't wrong.

## Relationship to other rules

[`challenge-redundant-content.md`](challenge-redundant-content.md) covers a
related but distinct failure: the *same* content restated in two places
(duplication). This fragment covers a *single* passage being more
elaborate than its own content requires (verbosity), even with no
duplicate copy anywhere. "A point restated from multiple angles" here
means one passage circling its own point several ways, not the same point
appearing twice --- check both fragments on a substantive review, since a
paragraph can fail either, both, or neither.
