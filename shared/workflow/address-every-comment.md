When iterating on a PR with a reviewer, **address every in-scope flagged item**,
regardless of severity label. The reviewer's "Not a blocker", "minor", "nit",
"optional", "consider", or "if you want" labels are for prioritization, not a
free pass for the implementer.

For each flagged item, do exactly one of:

1. **Fix it in this PR.** The default path --- most nits are 1--3 line changes.
2. **Defer to a tracked issue.** Only when the fix expands the PR's scope (new
   feature, broader refactor, separate concern) or the requester has explicitly
   said this PR shouldn't grow. File a follow-up issue and reference it in a PR
   comment so the item isn't lost.

Then trigger another review and repeat until the PR is **fully clean** --- zero
flagged items under any heading, no "non-blocking", "harmless", "minor
observation", or "could improve" sections. "Looks good" / "no findings" /
"approved" with no follow-on bullets is the bar. Resolve every inline review
thread along the way, leaving only the final all-clear exchange.

**Always resolve an inline thread the moment its comment is successfully
addressed** --- the fix pushed and a reply posted naming it --- in the same
pass, whatever workflow you're in: a formal `ard`/`ardi` round, a CI-monitor
nudge, or a one-off fix outside any loop. Addressing without resolving leaves
a thread that reads as outstanding work to every later reviewer, blocks
[`fully-clean`](fully-clean.md)'s every-inline-thread-resolved criterion, and
drags stale noise into the next review round. The per-disposition settlement
rules in `ard` step 4b still govern the exceptions: a **Rebut** stays open
until the reviewer drops it, and an **Address** you're not confident fully
settles the concern gets a reply asking for confirmation instead of a
resolve. The `resolve-pr-threads` skill sweeps any stragglers, but it's a
backstop --- resolve-on-address is the default, not a cleanup step.

Do **not** report "ready to merge with one minor nit noted" / "harmless as-is" /
"can address if you want" --- that hedging just pushes triage back to the
requester. If after 3--4 rounds the reviewer keeps generating new nits each
cycle (asymptotic noise), surface that and ask whether to keep going or accept
the current state.

**Noise is per-item, not per-round --- don't stop the whole loop over one
recurring flag.** A long-running PR can have both real findings (worth fixing
every round) and one specific item the reviewer re-raises verbatim round after
round even though it's already deferred/tracked (e.g. a file-length guideline
already split into a follow-up issue). Keep fixing every *new* finding as it
appears --- don't let the recurring item make you stop processing genuinely
new ones. But stop re-litigating *that one item* every round: reply once
pointing at the tracked issue, and hold on it specifically rather than
re-deferring it on each pass. Surface the pattern to the user (which item, how
many rounds, where it's tracked) and let them decide whether to resolve it now
(e.g. do the split) or leave it as accepted recurring noise --- don't decide
unilaterally to either keep re-processing it or silently drop it. (rme#706 ran
100+ review rounds: each round's *new* findings --- a missing derivation step,
a missing i.i.d. hypothesis, an unverified citation locator --- got fixed
every time; the one recurring file-length flag got a single reply-and-hold
each round until the user weighed in.)

**When a finding is a pattern (a formatting/style rule broken in one spot),
apply it everywhere it recurs in the same file, not just the flagged line.**
A reviewer that flags one inconsistent list-item format is telling you about
the rule, not just that one item --- fix every occurrence in the same file that
breaks it in the same pass, rather than waiting for the reviewer to flag each
occurrence in a separate round. Re-scan the whole changed file for the same
pattern before pushing the fix.

**When a prose fix changes wording that's also paraphrased elsewhere in the
same PR (a CHANGELOG entry, a PR description, a cross-reference), sync that
copy too.** A CHANGELOG entry written before the review lands often quotes or
paraphrases the exact phrase a reviewer later flags; fixing the source
prose but leaving the paraphrase stale reintroduces the same wording issue
one file over. Grep the diff for the flagged phrase before considering the
finding closed. (ai-config#373: fixed "routing/dispatch site" in the skill
per review, but the CHANGELOG entry still said it until a follow-up commit.)

**This generalizes to a skill's own inline restatement of a fragment it
links to.** A `SKILL.md` that links a backing `shared/` fragment for the
full detail often *also* restates the fragment's approach or word list
inline (in its `description` field, or a short procedure-step summary) so
a reader doesn't have to open the linked file. Fixing a bug in the
fragment doesn't automatically fix these inline restatements --- they're a
second, independent copy of the same claim, and a review round after the
fragment fix can catch them going stale exactly like a CHANGELOG paraphrase
does. Grep the whole PR diff for the fixed phrase/word-list, not just the
fragment file, before considering a fragment fix complete. (`ai-config#507`:
fixing `forward-references.md`'s regex left `fix-forward-references/SKILL.md`'s
own `description` field and Step 2 summary describing the old, already-fixed
approach --- caught in a second review round.)
