When iterating on a PR with a reviewer, **address every in-scope flagged item**,
regardless of severity label. The reviewer's "Not a blocker", "minor", "nit",
"optional", "consider", or "if you want" labels are for prioritization, not a
free pass for the implementer.

For each flagged item, do exactly one of:

1. **Fix it in this PR.** The default path --- most nits are 1--3 line changes.
2. **Defer to a tracked issue.** Only when the fix expands the PR's scope (new
   feature, broader refactor, separate concern) or the requester has explicitly
   said this PR shouldn't grow. File a follow-up issue and reference it in a PR
   comment so the item isn't lost.

Then trigger another review and repeat until the PR is **fully clean** --- zero
flagged items under any heading, no "non-blocking", "harmless", "minor
observation", or "could improve" sections. "Looks good" / "no findings" /
"approved" with no follow-on bullets is the bar. Resolve every inline review
thread along the way, leaving only the final all-clear exchange.

Do **not** report "ready to merge with one minor nit noted" / "harmless as-is" /
"can address if you want" --- that hedging just pushes triage back to the
requester. If after 3--4 rounds the reviewer keeps generating new nits each
cycle (asymptotic noise), surface that and ask whether to keep going or accept
the current state.

**Noise is per-item, not per-round --- don't stop the whole loop over one
recurring flag.** A long-running PR can have both real findings (worth fixing
every round) and one specific item the reviewer re-raises verbatim round after
round even though it's already deferred/tracked (e.g. a file-length guideline
already split into a follow-up issue). Keep fixing every *new* finding as it
appears --- don't let the recurring item make you stop processing genuinely
new ones. But stop re-litigating *that one item* every round: reply once
pointing at the tracked issue, and hold on it specifically rather than
re-deferring it on each pass. Surface the pattern to the user (which item, how
many rounds, where it's tracked) and let them decide whether to resolve it now
(e.g. do the split) or leave it as accepted recurring noise --- don't decide
unilaterally to either keep re-processing it or silently drop it. (rme#706 ran
100+ review rounds: each round's *new* findings --- a missing derivation step,
a missing i.i.d. hypothesis, an unverified citation locator --- got fixed
every time; the one recurring file-length flag got a single reply-and-hold
each round until the user weighed in.)
