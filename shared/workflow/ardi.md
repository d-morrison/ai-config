Whenever you are working a PR/MR, run the full **ARDI** loop by default, without
being asked: **A**ddress every flagged item, **R**ebut findings that are wrong,
**D**efer out-of-scope items to tracked issues, then **I**terate with a fresh
review --- repeating until the latest review is **fully clean**. Don't stop at
"review-clean, just needs approval" and hand triage back; keep the cycle going
until it's genuinely clean.

The loop's terminal action is to **report the PR ready, not to merge it**.
Merging is human-gated --- it happens only on an explicit human "merge it" (the
`merge-it` skill), never as a step ARDI takes on its own. So when you carry a PR
across a `ScheduleWakeup` or `/loop` wait, **never** bake a self-merge directive
like "if clean and CI green, merge it" into the wakeup/loop prompt: a scheduled
prompt fires back as a user-role turn, so a self-authored "merge it" only *looks*
like human approval (and Claude Code's auto-mode classifier will rightly deny it
as a self-authored merge). Drive to fully clean, report ready, and leave the
merge --- and any other destructive one-off, e.g. a `gh workflow run` that
force-pushes --- for explicit human authorization.

The one exception: if the human has explicitly granted the `mwc`
(merge-when-confident) session permission, that grant is a live human
instruction, not a self-authored one, so baking a self-merge step into a
wakeup/loop prompt is fine for the rest of that session. See
[`mwc`](../../skills/mwc/SKILL.md) for the grant's scope and limits.

In the **clear-all family** (`ardia`, `gia`, `gii`, `gip`), "report ready, don't
merge" gates only the merge --- it does **not** pause the sweep. A
clean-but-unmerged PR is not a stop; move to the next item, and stack it when it
isn't naturally independent of that PR. See
[`stack-dont-pause`](stack-dont-pause.md).

**Self-review against the project's own stated conventions before the first
push.** Don't treat the review bot as the mechanism that discovers a
project's documented conventions --- self-apply them first. When a project's
own `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent agent doc) already states specific criteria
--- a DRY/no-duplication rule, a doc-sync checklist for a new input, a
changelog-category rule, a citation requirement, a "new logic needs test
coverage" norm --- a first-pass implementation checked only against feature
correctness forces the review loop to spend a round re-deriving what the
project's own docs already said. Before the first push, re-read the
project's own stated review criteria and check the diff against each one
directly, instead of waiting for the bot to enumerate them one per round.
([gha#219](https://github.com/d-morrison/gha/issues/219)/[#220](https://github.com/d-morrison/gha/pull/220): one review round surfaced five findings --- a DRY
duplication, an incomplete-coverage doc overclaim, a wrong changelog
category, an uncited claim, and missing test coverage for new logic --- all
catchable this way, since each was a direct match against gha's own
`CLAUDE.md` conventions, not new information the review surfaced.)

**Proactively self-correct a technical claim you already told a reviewer,
the moment further testing shows it was wrong --- don't wait for the
reviewer to catch it.** If you stated a rationale (an approach is safe, a
risk doesn't apply, a backstop exists) and then discover through your own
follow-up verification that it's false, post the correction with the actual
evidence immediately, rather than leaving the stale claim standing until a
review round re-raises it. This keeps the review loop converging instead of
churning on a claim you already know is wrong. (`d-morrison/rme#989` /
`ucdavis/epi204#363`: after telling both reviewers `references.bib` didn't
share `CLAUDE.md`'s union-merge corruption risk, a follow-up merge
simulation showed it does --- posted the correction with repro steps on
both PRs before either reviewer re-raised it.)
