# Skills

Skills are markdown files that teach Claude Code a reusable workflow. Each `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file describes when to invoke the skill, what steps to follow, and which tools it may use. Claude Code discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/` automatically.

Codex uses generated wrappers in `codex-skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Those wrappers keep Codex frontmatter strict and point back to the canonical Claude skill in `skills/`, so the workflow stays in one place.

## How to invoke a skill

| Surface | Syntax |
|----|----|
| Local CLI | `/skill-name` or a bare keyword (e.g. `ardi`) |
| Plugin (other repos) | `/ai-config:skill-name` |
| `@claude` bot on PRs | `@claude skill-name` in a PR comment |
| Codex | skill trigger from `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills` |

Most skills also respond to plain-English triggers listed in their `description` field (e.g. “grab an issue”, “drive to clean”, “update memories and skills”).

## Skill categories

## Full skill list

All 171+ canonical skills are in [`skills/`](https://github.com/d-morrison/ai-config/tree/main/skills) on GitHub. Generated Codex wrappers live in [`codex-skills/`](https://github.com/d-morrison/ai-config/tree/main/codex-skills). Each canonical `SKILL.md` has a `description` field that lists the trigger phrases and a full procedure.
